"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

Rocklin High School has a large variety of clubs that cover a broad range of topics.  There are long standing academic clubs such as CSF and French Club as well as social clubs such as Picnic Club and Poetry Club.  If you don't see a club that interests you, than start your own!  The only criteria for starting a club is that you share a similar interest as other people.  We've even had a club in the past titled "The Johnny Depp Appreciation League".  Some clubs have lasted over a decade while others come and go each year.
If you would like to start a club download the following two documents and follow the instructions.

How to a correct a NM?
There are only two types of grades on a progress report: “P” indicates a passing grade the class; “NM” indicates that a student is in danger of not passing the class.
A NM may be corrected upon completion of missing assignments and/or clearing essential concepts or skills and/or test. Any questions regarding a NM grade, contact the teacher.
What does a NM (No Mark) mean?
A progress report is a mid-quarter report of progress in a class. The report helps evaluate a student's success in each class during the quarter.
Information for Students and Parents about Progress Reports, No Marks, and No Credits
What can I do to avoid NM’s and NC’s in the future?
What is a progress report?
What is the difference between a NM (No Mark) and a NC (No Credit)?
May a NC be changed?
Use a planner to help track assignments. Write due dates in your planner for assignments. Highlight the dates to help you remember important information. Use the grade check in your planner to keep track of your grades in your classes.
A NM may indicate that an assignment has not been turned in, passed a quiz or a test, have not completed all of the work for a class, and/or learned an essential concept or skill. If this work is not completed or made up, a student may not pass the class.
All students receive a progress report is available on the Aeries portal: September, November, February, and April.
A NC is a final semester grade posted by the teacher. This may require a student to repeat the semester in summer school, night school or in a proceeding semester, if applicable.
A NM is a progress or quarter report grade that may be corrected. A NC is a final semester grade.

_Counseling_Peer-Counseling_index
Peer Counselors will learn about issues that students in our community face: teen depression, anxiety, bullying, academic/learning struggles, eating disorders, drug abuse, etc. We will read about and discuss these topics at our training sessions in an educational format. We also will be involved in creating acts of kindness to spread around our campus.
The Peer Counseling Program is based on this simple premise: Within every school an informal “helping network” exists. Students with problems naturally seek out other students, counselors, teachers, or other school staff whom they trust. Students look to Peer Counselors for advice, assistance or just a sympathetic ear. The Peer Counselors are trained by school counselors in skills they need to provide more effective help to young people who seek them out. Peer Counselors are not professionally trained therapists or counselors. Knowing one’s limitations in a helping situation is repeatedly emphasized and reviewed with students. A significant amount of focus is placed on knowing when to refer a friend who may be at risk to a School Counselor.
Peer Counseling is a program used across the United States. It serves students who want to strengthen their communication and helping skills. The program provides an avenue whereby students can support their peers and, at the same time, extends the opportunity to students to provide a service to their school and community.

_Counseling_Valedictorian-Selection_index
UC approved Rocklin Unified School District Honors and Advanced Placement courses will be awarded one extra grade point in the GPA calculation.
Potential valedictorian candidates will be identified after the first semester report card is issued of the senior year and a meeting will be held with potential candidates.
Potential valedictorian candidates may be dropped from the list based on senior year grades if they fall below the top two percent qualification following spring semester grades.
Valedictorian status is awarded to the top two percent of senior class students based on total weighted GPA in grades 9th through 12th.This number is based on the number of students enrolled in the senior class at the beginning of their senior year. If more than two percent of the senior class make up the lowest qualifying GPA, all students tied at the lowest qualifying GPA are valedictorians.
All high school courses will be included in the calculation of the total weighted GPA in grades 9th through 12th.
Valedictorian Evaluation Criteria:
“High school level courses” taken in middle school and college courses taken during high school will not be included in the GPA calculation.
Rocklin High School Class Valedictorians represent the top academic performers of the graduating class.
Weighted grades will be assigned only for Honors and Advanced Placement courses offered in the Rocklin Unified School District for transfer students from schools in California, out of state, and out of the country.
Students must be enrolled in Rocklin High School by the beginning of the first semester of senior year to be considered for class valedictorian.
ROCKLIN HIGH SCHOOL VALEDICTORIAN SELECTION CRITERIA
Final valedictorian status will be confirmed based on the eighth semester report card at the end of senior year.
Students may be removed from the valedictorian list if it is determined by administration that they do not meet acceptable Rocklin/Whitney High School standards of academics.

(Reference:
. Your health and well-being come first. If you're feeling stretched thin, prioritize your commitments and cut out what isn't fulfilling and truly important to you.
Make sure that the people in your life are upbeat, positive, and know how to enjoy life!
Help your child establish a regular sleep and wake cycle (Students need 8 to 9 hours of sleep each night).
onitor how they spend their time
Take a close look at your calendar and carve out one or two hours for self-care and stick to it. This may take extra prep, but it's worth it.

What happens when students aren't getting the sleep they need?  Lack of consistent, appropriate sleep leads to increased academic stress, hindered concentration and learning, and disturbances to your students' mood and ability to cope.
National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline
Surround yourself with great people.
In order to live a healthy and rewarding life, self-care is a necessity. With this mindset, prioritizing self-care can become very natural and easy to do.
If you don't have huge chunks of time, you can still fit in little moments of relaxation. Don't wait to add self-care to your life until your schedule frees up (you might be waiting a while to forever). Try taking just five minutes to close your eyes and take some deep breaths, or go for a quick 10-minute walk. These small steps can make a big difference.
romote balance and core values
(Mayo Clinic)
Remember that self-care is non-negotiable.
Ask yourself these critical questions: "Am I working too much?" "Do I feel tapped out?" "What do I need to take away?" "What would I like to add?"

Welcome to AP Econ!  I’m very excited about this class and opportunity to explore economics together.  I hope that we will successfully accomplish three main goals this year.  First of all, each student will gain a significant and meaningful education concerning economics and its centrality in our daily lives and the world around us.  My second goal is that every student would attempt and successfully complete the AP exam.  Thirdly, I really want you to enjoy this class.  I firmly believe that all students learn more when they are enjoying themselves.  I will do all I can to make the course interesting and fun, but your enthusiasm is a vital part of achieving this goal.  Let’s have a memorable and successful year!

Prep/Office Hours:
AP Microeconomics satisfies the senior year graduation requirements for social studies.  For most of the year, we will focus on the study of microeconomics, particularly the operation of the free market economy and the theory of the firm.  In doing so, we will prepare for the AP exam in microeconomics.  In addition, the course will include coverage of macroeconomics and American government.
The essential concepts of each unit are listed below.  Students must demonstrate a solid understanding of each essential concept in order to pass the course.

OTHER INFORMATION: Statistics is unlike other mathematics offered at Rocklin High School.  Students will be required to completely explain their answers in addition to computations.  The ability to write and communicate statistics effectively is a major component of the AP test and students will be required to demonstrate this ability in this class.  Extra help is available before school, after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and other times by appointment.  Parent/ Teacher Communication can be made through email or voicemail.  Email is the preferred method and response time is usually quicker than through a voicemail message.   I am looking forward to a great year and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

AP College Board Website
AP U.S. History is designed to be the equivalent of a two-semester introductory college or university U.S. history course.
The AP U.S. History Course focuses on developing students' understanding of American history from approximately 1491 to the present. The course has students investigate the content of U.S. history for significant events, individuals, developments, and processes in nine historical periods, and develop and use the same thinking skills and methods (analyzing primary and secondary sources, making historical comparisons, chronological reasoning, and argumentation) employed by historians when they study the past. The course also provides seven themes (American and national identity; migration and settlement; politics and power; work exchange and technology; America in the world; geography and the environment; and culture and society) that students explore throughout the course in order to make connections among historical developments in different times and places.

2024-2025 Summer Homework LINK (updated 5/21/2024)
The purpose of the Advanced Placement Modern World History course is to develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts, in interaction with different types of human societies. This understanding is advanced through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. The course highlights the nature of changes in international frameworks and their causes and consequences, as well as comparisons among major societies. It emphasizes relevant factual knowledge used in conjunction with leading interpretive issues and types of historical evidence. The course builds on an understanding of cultural, institutional, and technological precedents that, along with geography, set the human stage. Periodization, explicitly discussed, forms an organizing principle for dealing with change and continuity throughout the course. Specific themes provide further organization to the course, along with consistent attention to contacts among societies that form the core of world history as a field of study. Students who pass the AP exam may receive college credit, advanced placement or both depending on the policies at the specific institution. Students should anticipate nightly reading/assignments. Throughout the year, students will develop skills in SAQs, DBQ and LEQ Essays, stimulus based MCQs, and high level class discussions.

Where it all began...
2010-2012
Coach Michael Lorente became the 2nd coach in Rocklin Basketball history. He coached for 2 years before leaving RHS.
Coach Casey Cutts, a former player of Coach Taylor, became the 3rd coach in Rocklin Basketball history. Coach Cutts played at Rocklin from 2001-2004 and left his coaching duties in 2016 after 4 years in the lead.
1993 - 2010
Coach Steve Taylor is back at the helm where he has added two more SFL Championships, numerous SJS playoff wins, and multiple Norcal playoff wins. Coach Taylor eclipsed the 500 career win mark in 2024 while guiding the Thunder to a SFL Championship, and D1 SJS Semi-Finals appearance, and a Norcal tournament appearance.
2012-2016
2016-Present
Rocklin Basketball began its HUSTLE roots in 1993 when Coach Steve Taylor became the first Head Basketball coach when Rocklin HS opened. Coach Taylor grew up in the Rocklin area and attended Roseville HS where he played Football and Basketball. He then went on to play basketball at Fresno Pacific University. He began his teaching career in the Clovis/Fresno area before moving back to Rocklin to become the inaugural Head Coach.

Varsity Coach - Tim Hurrianko
This is my 24th year coaching golf at Rocklin High school, and it's been one of the highlights of my teaching career. I have had the privilege of working with a plethora of wonderful young men, some of whom have went on to successful collegiate careers, and one now on the Korn Ferry Tour. Golf is a wonderful metaphor for life, and it has privided a lifetime of memories thanks to these wonderful players.

I began playing Water Polo at 13 years old, two weeks before competing in my first Junior Olympic Tournament. Fortunately, I had been swimming since the age of 5, providing me with a solid foundation for the game. I continued to play at Woodcreek HS, as well as year around with a competitive club. I went on to play at Cal Lutheran University, where I earned a B.A. in English, eventually adding a Masters in Education. I now work as a teacher here at Rocklin High School in the Social Studies Department. In addition to RHS Water Polo, I also coach for the California Republic Club Program in an effort to help student-athletes reach their greatest potential while competing at the highest level.

Student instructions to create your account.
ssessments can serve to help students learn about their interests and discover where they may fit in terms of professional occupations. Personal assessments serve to help students narrow their options to a group of potential career choices. This allows students to do more thorough research on occupations before they make a decision about which to pursue.
Online programs are fun to play around with and explore.
Career exploration
In order for your student to utilize Scoir through Rocklin Unified School District they need to create an account through a link that is sent to them through RHS.
They can not just register on the Scoir website they need to register through the link given to them.  Otherwise they will not be linked correctly through their school.

_subsites_Career-Center_College-Planning_Applying-to-Colleges_Appealing-to-Colleges_index
If the school does not give much in the way of guidelines, here are some things to consider:
Hopefully you built a great list of colleges to apply to that included safety schools that you would be happy to attend. If not, all is not lost. It is not too late to apply to community college or schools with rolling admission.
Check out the school’s admission department webpage or call to get information on appeals. Some schools do not accept them at all, some outline a very specific process and some give no information on the subject at all.
Application Deadlines
Address your letter to the correct person/department. Your school may have specific instructions for this. If not, addressing the letter to your local admissions representative is an excellent choice. You may be able to find that information on the college website or from the College and Career Center at your high school. If that information is not available, look for an address for a dean of admissions or a generic address for the admissions department.
Appealing to a College
Applying to Colleges
Accept an offer at a school that has accepted you and move on before deadlines pass. Expect a “no” answer from your appeal and prepare to go elsewhere. Start arranging housing and attend admitted student events at the school from which you have accepted an offer. If you get your decision changed, it will be a nice surprise, but if not (which is far more likely) you will be ready and excited to attend the next best college for you!
Do it right away. Some schools will list deadlines for appeals and some will not. In either case, for the best chance of getting your decision reversed, get it in as early as possible.
Always present your appeal as additional information that may show you as a stronger candidate than your original application alone. Things like your desire, statistics that show you are within their range of accepted students, the fact that your best friend got in, or that Stanford accepted you do not show that you are a stronger candidate than perceived by your application. Remember that your original application was thoroughly considered, so do not repeat information that was included there.
Scholarships & Financial Aid
Good Reasons to Appeal
Read your rejection letter carefully for clues as to why you were not accepted. Some schools use the same general letter for everyone, but some will individualize these. If you know the reasons, be sure to address them in your appeal if you have new evidence that better supports you as a candidate.
If you have a reason to appeal that you feel is worthy and your school allows for appeals, here are some tips:
Reasons That Might Work For an Appeal
Be sure and thank the reader for the time already spent reviewing your initial application and the opportunity to present more information. Never tell them that they have made a mistake or that you disagree with their decision.
You have overcome a significant hardship of which you did not make the admission department aware in your application. If you had a major health issue your sophomore year that led to missing many days resulting in lowered grades, you may want to explain that. Reasons need to be significant though, such as illness, death in the family, etc. “I was just not motivated, but now I am” is not a significant reason.
Students with lower GPA and/or test scores were admitted but you were not. There are often MANY factors other than GPA and test scores that go into admissions decisions. It is not uncommon for this to happen.
The process of accepting and declining applicant students is an arduous one for admissions departments. Many schools receive far more qualified applicants than they have room for and difficult decisions must be made. If you have received a rejection notice but think that you are qualified, you probably want to argue your case. But first, do some research and think about your specific situation.
You don’t think the decision is fair. College admission doesn’t have to be fair and you likely do not have all of the information that went into this decision. This is your opinion and appeals need to be made based on facts.
This is your first choice school and it has always been your dream to attend. This does not add anything to your application and tells the admission department nothing new about you. They assume you want to attend because you submitted your application in the first place. Schools do not admit students based on their desire alone.
here was a mistake on your application that needs to be corrected. Was a score or grade reported incorrectly?
Inappropriate Reasons to Appeal
College Planning Workshops
College Admission Waitlists & Appeals
If your school outlines a specific process for appeals and you feel that you fit the requirements, then go for it, but stick to their guidelines. If they only allow appeals for very specific circumstances that do not apply to you, don’t waste everyone’s time trying to fit a round peg in a square hole.
Obtain and include a letter of recommendation from someone (not a family member) who can confirm the new information that you are presenting and attest to the likelihood of your success at the college level.
Appealing to Colleges
If your school does not accept appeals, then your best option is to start looking at their transfer requirements and plan to apply again in a few years as a transfer student. Of course you could take a gap year and apply again as a freshman next year, but if your application wouldn’t change in that period of time, your chances of getting in likely wouldn’t either.
You got accepted to more competitive schools. Every school evaluates applicants in their own unique way. What other schools have decided has no bearing on your admission.
You have new and compelling information that was not included on your application. Perhaps you have retaken the SAT or ACT since your application and now have a significantly higher score. Maybe you have been granted an important award or honor since your application was submitted.
Your grades the first semester of your senior year show a significant improvement from the transcript that you submitted with your application. Some schools may consider this as new and compelling information while others may not. In either case, your current grades would need to be considerably better than the past grades that you submitted in your application and you should include some reason for the improvement as evidence that you would be able to sustain those higher grades in college. If your grades have always been good and you have kept them up again in the fall of your senior year, this is not new information.
Keep it brief (unlike this document). With the ease of online applications, the number of students applying to nearly all schools continues to rise. With that means more rejections and more appeals. Admissions reps have just spent a significant amount of time pouring over applications, and now they are being asked to do it again with the appeals. Make sure your letter is personal, but also brief and to the point. If it is too long, begging, or presenting irrelevant information, it is unlikely to help your situation.

Students able to apply early action to several schools.
Application decision from school comes early,
Early action and early decision programs require students to submit their applications on an earlier deadline than regular admission. Decisions on early action and early decision applications are typically made in December, giving students a larger amount of time to plan for enrollment in the fall. If you are considering early decision, make sure that you are prepared to attend that particular school regardless of what financial aid package you are offered. An early decision applicant will not have the ability to compare financial aid packages from other schools prior to accepting an offer.
Submission window 10/01/2023 - 11/30/2023

Considering appealing a college admissions decision?
Have you been placed on a college admissions waiting list?
The unfortunate reality is that most students placed on a waiting list, do not eventually get and acceptance letter. You should plan to move forward with a school that has accepted you so that you do not miss important deadlines. If you do eventually get accepted from the waiting list, you will need to consider the amount of deposit money you will be forfeiting at the school you have already accepted admission to as well as if any important financial aid, housing or registrations dates have passed at the wait-list school. You will need to weigh anything that you may be missing out on because of your late acceptance. The College Board has published a nice article outlining what to do and how to better your chances of being accepted from a waiting list. You can read that article

Letter of Recommendation Request Form
If you need a letter of recommendation from a school staff member for a college application, scholarship, or program application, please complete the form below and give it to them along with a copy of your transcript and your extra-curricular activities resume. Make sure you give them plenty of time (at least 2 weeks), because these things tend to be seasonal and teachers are often asked to write them for several students. It is always best to have a conversation with the teacher regarding what the letter is needed for and which of your attributes they should focus the letter on. It may feel like bragging, but understanding what exactly you need in the letter will really help the teacher give you the best recommendation possible.

The most critical thing to consider when looking at colleges is the match between college and student. Finding a college that offers a major you want is great, but chances are your interests and major will change before you graduate. Make sure the school is a good fit and feel for all of your needs, not just academic.
How many students are there?

Scoir (pronounced like "score") is our college and career research platform. Every Rocklin High School student has an account and just needs to activate it through the invitation in their Rocklin USD email.

How big (or small) are the classes?
Scoir includes great college research and application tools that all students should explore!
Can I get in to this school? Can I afford to attend this school?
The answer to these questions will be different for every student, so it is strongly advised that students make independent decisions and not be influenced by where their friends are applying.

How should I prepare?
The UC and CSU systems have both moved to being Test Blind indefinitley.  They do not consider standardized test scores for admissions.  Test scores could still be used for othe purposes such as course placement and certain scholarships but they will not be used for admissions.
Students who have a test score and are applying to test optional schools should consider the policies and admissions statistics of the school before deciding to submit those scores. College and career center staff is available to assist students with this decision.
www.collegeboard.org
ACT official site:
Due to the inability of so many students to test since the spring of 2020, many colleges have changed their testing policies and may no longer require an SAT or ACT score for admissions. Some of these changes are temporary and some are permanent. It is encumbant upon the student to research the policies at each college to which they are interested in applying.
When are the tests offered? How do I register?
At this time (school year 2023-2024) it is the recommendation of Rocklin High School that students continue to attempt to take the SAT and/or ACT to provide for as many possible opportunities for college admissions and financial aid as possible if it is safe and reasonable for them to do so, however they should rest assured that many great opportunities are available without test scores this year.

There are many options for students when it comes to preparing for the SAT or ACT. As a school, we do not provide test prep classes, however there are some great options on our campus and online that are coordinated by outside vendors. Please visit their individual websites below for more information and to enroll.
This prep course is taught by two Granite Bay High School teachers. This class is offered throughout the year at Granite Bay High School and via Zoom. The course is typically four weeks long and broken into two sections (Math and English) so students may take either one or both. They also offer a week-long intensive summer workshop each year.

Additionally, the ACT has more questions than the SAT, but the SAT questions often require more lengthy reading and problem solving (so they take a little longer to complete).
Test Comparison
Both the SAT and the ACT are standardized tests that help colleges and universities determine how prepared you are, as a student, to take college-level courses.
The biggest difference is the amount of time allotted to each section of the test. The SAT allows more time per question for every section of the test, whereas the ACT requires you to move faster through the questions.
At first glance, the two tests don’t look very different. They take a similar amount of time to complete (between 3 hours and 35 minutes for the ACT, around 3 hours and 50 minutes for the SAT), and they cover all the same basic subjects: reading, writing, comprehension, problem solving, and mathematics. In the past, the two tests were more distinct from each other, but the SAT went through a massive revision and redesign in 2016, and now is very similar to the ACT’s format.
Additionally, all US colleges and universities accept both the ACT and the SAT, so there’s no direct advantage to taking one test over the other. However, despite all these similarities, there are also some surprising differences that might influence your choice.

Welcome to the Rocklin High School Chemistry Department!
If you need help, please feel free to set up an appointment with your teacher for help before school, after school, or at lunch, and we would be happy to help you.
Students, in order to access all the notes, worksheets, activities, etc., you will need to create an account in Schoology and join the Chemistry Course corresponding to your teacher and class period. You will need to see your teacher for that code. The last step is to be approved by your instructor before you will be able to access course information.
We look forward to working with you this year!

Rocklin High School student athletes are expected to conduct themselves in a respectable manner as a member of their teams and our Athletic program.  As a student athlete you are responsible for your social media use.  Any malicious use of social media platforms shall not be tolerated.  Malicious use may include, but not be limited to:
STUDENT – PARENT ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION INFORMATION
•	Incriminating photos or statements regarding illegal criminal behavior, underage drinking, use of illegal drugs, sexual harassment or violence.
•	Demeaning statements or threats that endanger the safety of another person.
As a student athlete I have reviewed and carefully read, with my parent(s) / legal guardian, the Social Media Policy and agree to abide to all provisions contained within.  Furthermore, I understand that a violation of said rules may result in loss of athletic privileges and/or suspension from participation.
•	Derogatory language or remarks regarding fellow athletes, students, coaches, administrators, faculty and staff of Rocklin High School or other high schools.
Social Media – (Class II Infraction) Athletic Code of Conduct

Any form of messaging, digital magazines, internet forums, web-blogs, podcasts, photographs, video, rating and social bookmarking found on websites or applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr that is open to public viewing is considered to be social media.  This is a rapidly changing network as we move into the 21st Century, and many more not mentioned will arise, which are also included in this policy. Violations of this policy are subject to investigation and sanctions outlined in the Rocklin High School Code of Conduct (page 10), and are also subject to review by state and federal law enforcement.  These fall under Class II Infractions.  Any and all disciplinary measures may apply depending on the severity of the infraction.

_subsites_Girls-Golf_Spectator-Guidelines_index
Spectators are welcome to attend practices, matches, or tournaments.  However, the following guidelines and expectations are to be followed at all times.  Failure to follow the following guidelines and expectations could result in penalty strokes for the players and/or you could be asked to leave the golf course.  Also, please share this information with any family members or friends who may attend a practice, match, or tournament.
• Carts may be used by spectators, however you may be required to pay for the cart and you should always check into the pro shop to get a cart checked out.  Carts are to remain on cart paths at all times!
o No denim or blue jeans may be worn.
• Spectators are to maintain a distance of at least 30 yards from the players at all times.

2. An Introduction to Rhetoric: Using the "Available Means" (selected readings with M/C quizzes and writing activities)
The skills, in which the student must show proficiency, will be assessed through a variety of larger assignments (aka Essential Skills Assessment- ESA). The ESA will clearly define a set of skills necessary for a passing grade. If the skill(s) are not achieved, the student will have an assigned time to correct his/her assignment to show proficiency. If the attempt is made and proficiency is still not achieved, then the student will have more time assigned to show proficiency in the skill(s). This process will continue until the student achieves mastery or the semester comes to a close. If the student fails to master the skill(s) required by the end of the semester or doesn’t attempt the skill(s) during the window of time given, then the lack of mastered skill(s) will result in a NC for the semester. Any ESA assignments turned in late can receive no higher than a C-. In-class work or smaller assignments must be turned in on time or the student will receive half credit for that particular assignment if turned in within a reasonable amount of time from the original assigned due date. Students that miss assignments due to an excused absence will receive no late penalty. If a student misses an assignment, for what ever reason, the student should take it upon themselves to communicate with me in person so that we can come up with a reasonable solution to the missing points.

Honors English is a challenging course that expands on all four realms of Language Arts (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). Students will not only be exposed to assigned fictional literature but also much of the class will focus on non-fictional text such as speeches, essays, editorials, and even visual art like advertisements and political cartoons. The class will expose students to rhetorical strategies, close reading techniques, argumentations, and synthesizing outside sources. These skills will help students expand their understanding of analysis and help them develop as a write. Students will be expected to demonstrate understanding of the material through participation in Socratic seminars, take-home essays, timed in-class essays, debates, classroom discussion, and formal exams. Extensive writing will be developed through a variety of techniques and styles, and students will be engaged in activities that advance speaking, listening, and presentation skills.

Ultimately, the responsibility of turning in the assignment on time rests on the student. Here is a breakdown of the grading scale. 70% of the grade is based on ESA results, 10% on AR and the other 20% on everything else assigned (vocabulary, quizzes, timed writes etc.)

My goal is to hold the student accountable for the work assigned and to be sympathetic to the student’s particular situation. It is important for students to understand that without personal communication on their own behalf, I assume the student missed the assignment because of a bad decision. And—might I add—making mistakes is okay as long as we learn from those mistakes! Some of the greatest lessons in life are derived from making errors. They are life lessons. But do not worry, these types of mistakes only become significantly problematic when the mistakes reoccur.

Mr. Jeffrey James
Twelfth grade language arts provides a rigorous thematic course of study designed to acquaint students with the demands of college-level work. Our work will explore the question: What is the self? Content has been selected to illuminate different aspects of the theme of identity: How do we define ourselves in relation to family, friends, culture, society and government? How do people gain or lose control of their identities? Who are we and who do we want to be? Students read extensively from a rich world literature curriculum (up to 100 pages per week in novels, plays, short stories, nonfiction and poetry) and write frequently for different purposes and audiences and in a variety of styles (including expository and analytical essays, short fiction, poetry, and informal responses to literature and discussion). Writing assignments emphasize the development of academic skills necessary for students to thrive in college course work. Direct grammar and usage instruction are connected to specific writing assignments and to the needs and interests of students. Writing skills developed include: smooth integration of quotations, closing analytical gaps in argumentation, research organization, use of active voice, pronoun usage, punctuation, conventions of academic writing, use of MLA style, and other areas based on student interest or need. In addition, senior language arts classes aim to develop important skills in speaking and listening through collaboration, presentation and, especially, through Socratic seminar discussion. In these discussions (which form a touchstone for the learning of the course), students take a leadership role, helping to set the agenda for discussion and assuming facilitation duties.

Math Analysis will focus on extending students knowledge from Algebra II and introducing topics from trigonometry and discrete mathematics.  These topics include: trigonometry (unit circle and triangle definitions, trigonometric values of important angles, identities, and numerous applications), conic sections, inequalities, and the exploration and interpretation of functions. These functions include: algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, rational and polynomial functions. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of statistics and data analysis. Students are expected to be active learners in this class. Important keys for success are:
Note:  If a student is in danger of not passing Spring semester, Math Tutorial credit may be given at the end of Spring semester  to those students with an overall percentage above 60% and homework percentage above 70%. This is at the teacher’s discretion.
OVERVIEW
The teacher will have very few calculators for students to use during class. Since classes are going to be large, it is recommended that students have their own graphing calculators. The Rocklin High School mathematics’ department recommends the TI-83 or TI-84, although other calculators are acceptable.

YES! Students may earn back points lost due to lack of participation, fitness, non-suits, absences, etc… by participating in correctives offered during any Flex period.
NO: PE Shorts must be Royal Blue, shirts must be Gray
SAMPLE NOTE
Yes- Physical Education is rooted in participation.  Students who are absent will be encouraged to attend correctives during Flex time.  Any assessments/written assignments missed will also need to be made up.
t?
Students not participating in P.E. due to parent note are REQUIRED to dress in P.E. uniform (unless physically unable to)  and participate in a modified activity (when appropriate). If they are unable to participate in the activities they may earn their points when they are heathly enought to do so during Plus Period   (See Flex Period PE Make-Ups)
4. Are "soffe" shorts okay?
What about sweatshirts or pants?
Students who are not able to participate will not earn daily participation points.  IF activities can be modified appropriately and safely with direction from the Physician, students may be able to earn partial to full credit.  Student missing participation have the opportunity to earn any points missed during Flex Period (see Flex Period PE Make-Ups)
:  If your student needs to be excused for PE please send a note on the day you would like them excused.  Our goal is to keep students engaged whenever possible/appropriate. Please include specific information so that whenever possible we can MODIFY activity to keep your student involved. Notes should include students first and last name, date, and reason along with a parent signature and contact information. If the student is unable to earn participation points, by completeing the daily activites, they will be encouraged to attend and participation in Flex time to earn missed points.
3.  Does my student "lose points" if they have a doctor's note.
Writing a note
YES!
NO:  RHS PE requires that students wear shorts of appropriate length- think basketball or soccer style shorts.  "Short" shorts are not appropriate.
10. If I have filed a medical form with the main office, why do I have to do another one for the PE Department?
Two reasons; first- it can take some time for information to filter to us from the main office due to the volume of information they are dealing with.  Second, it helps us work with students and safely modify activity while holding them accountable for activities they should be doing/medications they should be using/etc
and will modify curriculum according to district policy  Some classes are affected more than others depending on time of day and activity.
RHS PE staff monitors the outside temperature and will modify curriculum according to district policy  Some classes are affected more than others depending on time of day and activity.
Will my student lose points when they are absent?
…
Will my student athlete lose points when they miss class due to RHS Athletic event?
Any health issues that may affect the student’s participation in P.E. activities needs to be documented by a Physician and on file with both the School Health Office and the P.E. Teacher before activity begins.(i.e. asthma, OSD, scoliosis, IBS, …)
Are black shirt/shorts okay ?
Students may wear them IF they are blue/gray.

MODIFIED PHYSICAL EDUCATION (MPE)
It is the understanding of the Physical Education department that if a student is well enough to attend school, then he/she is well enough to participate in Physical Education.  However, we also recognize that there are legitimate reasons for being excused from/modifying physical activity. In the event the student cannot participate fully they can earn their points during Flex time Make-ups.  Our goal is to have students engaged in daily activities so if we can apporpriately and safely modify their activity a student may still earn points.
: is for students who are physically unable to participate in any activity during class due to permanent illness or injury as documented by a physician.  These students will meet with their counselor to work on course placement.  These students will not earn credit for the semester from which they are exempted.
Modified PE Letter
It is the goal of the RHS Physical Education Department to keep students actively involved whenever possible and appropriate.  Goal number  one is the health and safety of of the student.  Students who are unable to participate due to injury or illness will not earn daily participation points.  Prompt and clear communication between Parent/Physician and Teacher is important.  If the Doctor specifically allows it, most activities can be  modified allowing students to remain engaged at an appropriate level until they can return to full participation.  Not all activites can be modified for all circumstances.  Not all modifications requested are available.  When in doubt, please email your P.E. teacher.  In the event the a student cannot participate they will have the opportunity to earn the points they missed during Flex Period PE Make-Ups.
is for those students who become ill or injured during the school year and are unable to continue, or will miss 6 weeks or more of class activity.  These students will be referred to their counselor as soon as the P.E. teacher receives medical documentation.  These students can earn course credit after minimum requirements (70%) have been met.  Students will have one full semester to complete any make-ups necessary to meet those requirements. Students may also choose to retake the semester at a later date (medical withdrawl).

There are many conditions that may limit but not exclude a student from participation in Physical Education activities.  These may include Asthma, Scoliosis, Diabetes, IBS and more.  Our goal is to ensure that each student participates appropriately to their full ability.

We cannot stress enough how important homework is to passing this class.  Students who do not complete assignments almost assuredly will struggle in the course. In addition, should you need help, please do not wait to ask.  We are available before school each day and other times by appointment. Please make sure your teacher knows you are coming so they can make room in their schedule.  We also recommend that students work in groups outside of class. Previous students have found this to be very effective.

Grades are not rounded up!
In pre-calculus/trigonometry, students will use geometry, algebra and new skills to achieve a deep understanding of the topics necessary for success in calculus. These topics include: trigonometry (unit circle and triangle definitions, trigonometric values of important angles, identities, and numerous applications), trigonometric form of complex numbers, De Moivre’s theorem, parametric and polar equations and graphs, and exploration and interpretation of functions. These functions include: algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, rational and polynomial functions. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of mathematical induction and limits. Students will be expected to do more work in this class than in any previous mathematics class. Important keys for success are:

Ex
Psychology and Sociology is an academic elective, fulfilling the UC and CSU “g” requirement.  We will spend the first semester and most of the second exploring Psychology, the study of individual human behavior and mental processes. For some of the second semester, we will explore Sociology, the study of social groups and interactions.  In both disciplines we will employ an interactive style, encouraging students to actively participate in their own learning.  In addition, we will emphasize current events and real world applications, demonstrating the relevance of the course content to the students’ lives.
-Sleep and Dreams, Altered States
Excused
-Testing, Traits and Abilities
Unit Seven:  Personality and Intelligence
Welcome to Psychology and Sociology!  Together, we will explore the exciting world of individual human thought and behavior, as well as social interaction.  My goals for you as a student are as follows.  First, that you would master the essentials of Psychology and Sociology.  Comprehending these subjects will certainly deepen your understanding of the world, yourself, and the people around you.  Secondly, I hope that we all enjoy the process of discovery.  I believe that learning can and should be fun!  Thirdly, I hope that this course awakens in you a desire to seek out more knowledge about human behavior and interaction.
Study of Psychology
Due to the nature of the course, we will study and discuss some sensitive topics. This will require a high level of maturity.  It is vital that we respect one another, and everyone’s right to express themselves.

Notebook: It is vital that you keep an organized notebook of lecture notes, handouts, and coursework in order to prepare for tests. In addition, your notebook will include a section of “Response Journal” entries, which will be turned in each semester as a required project.
Unit Three:  The Brain/Neuroscience
1) Demonstrate mastery of all essential skills and concepts. If any skills and concepts have not been mastered when a semester ends, a grade of no credit will be issued for that semester.
*Clearing a No Mark on a test will result in the score being changed to 70% if the original test score was greater than 50%.  If a student scores less than 50% on a test, the grade will be raised to 60% upon clearing the test.
Textbook:  For our study of Psychology, each student will check out a copy of the textbook, Understanding Psychology by Richard A. Kasschau.  For our study of Sociology, we will utilize the textbook, Sociology and You by Shepard and Greene, though students will not check out their own copy.
Unit Five:  Sensation and Perception
Grades will be determined according to the following scale:

Our varsity tennis team each year is the most academically successful sports program on campus measured by academic GPA.  Our Varsity team last year took over 50 AP courses.  We strive to be responsible student athletes.
Look at the Schedule (Start date August 5- Girls)(Feb. 3, 2025- Boys
TEAM: I try everyday to make sure we create a team environment and continue to work on creating team experiences that develop friendships and a bond that each tennis player can rely on.  We’ve had team activities ranging from white water rafting, waterskiing, paintballing, ocean kayaking, camping, hiking in Yosemite, horseback riding, surfing and yes tennis!!

It's pretty simple, how much time do you put in from now until August (girls) / February (boys).  I did have to let 8 girls / 3 boys go.  I still have not gotten word on practice restrictions for next year due to the late start.

Do you have to have prior experience?  No, sports transfer.  Basketball, softball/baseball and volleyball players make great tennis players.  I never played tennis growing up.  My first tennis was my freshman year, but I played basketball, baseball, football and shot archery.  Several of our players never played tennis before high school.

Tennis is only part of the fun.  Our goal is to create a family through experiences, competition, and team relationships.

Thanks again for your interest in girls tennis and if you have any questions please respond!
Is tennis a cut sport? Yes  We typically have 30-40 girls/boys on the tennis team and work hard to not cut.  I try hard to keep all freshmen to get them experiencing tennis.  If I get 10 freshmen out, great shouldn’t have to cut.  If I get 30, the math doesn’t work with 3 coaches and 8 courts.
We invite you to come out for the team as we encourage all athletes to participate at Rocklin High School.  We are coming off a great run with the Boys and Girls Teams winning section titles over the last 4 seasons.

Assistant Coach - Cheryl Winter
Our student athletes have developed a team that strives to include every athlete in numerous activities that support the whole tennis player.  As a player at Nevada Union High School I learned from Mr. Houlihan the value of the team and the importance of creating opportunities for the players who play the USTA circuit to the recreational player who wants local opportunities to learn their craft.
After raising four kids, who are now out of the house, I knew I wanted to get back into helping young students learn and grow their tennis skills.  I knew the impact my tennis coaches had on me as a teen and I am excited to be doing the same.  This is my 5th year coaching high school tennis at Rocklin High School.  I play tennis 3-5 days a week socially and on different competitive USTA teams.  When I'm not on the court, you'll find me visiting my kids, volunteering locally and hiking or skiing in the mountains!  I am ready to help the students find and develop their tennis skills.
Head Coach - Dale Eckenburg
Assistant Coach - Kelly Follett
I joined the coaching staff for the boy's team in 2016 when my son was a freshman.  I knew from that moment on this was a program that was going to be something special.  I joined the girls team the following year and have enjoyed being a part of both the girls and boys coaching staff ever since.  I love teaching the kids the game of tennis while instilling the values of hard work and being a team player.  In my free time, I love spending time with my family and enjoying the outdoors.  You can also find me on the courts playing in adult leagues, tournaments and as a USTA Roving Official.  I'm excited to be part of such an outstanding tennis program and working with such great kids.
After 20 years of guiding the RHS Tennis program; I still can't believe I get the chance to work with a wonderful group of young people. We have worked hard to develop a program that incorporates academics, tennis, fun and a sense of family.

After raising four kids, who are now out of the house, I knew I wanted to get back into helping young students learn and grow their tennis skills. I knew the impact my tennis coaches had on me as a teen and I am excited to be doing the same. This is my 4th year coaching at Rocklin High School coaching high school tennis. I play tennis 3-5 days a week socially and on different competitive USTA teams..When I’m not on the court, you’ll find me visiting my kids, volunteering locally and hiking or skiing in the mountains! I am ready to help the students find and develop their tennis skills.
After 20+ years of guiding the RHS Tennis program; I still can't believe I get the chance to work with a wonderful group of young people. We have worked hard to develop a program that incorporates academics, tennis, fun and a sense of family.

- A 3-subject spiral bound notebook, 8.5 x 11, College ruled
Students in grade eleven study the major turning points in American history in the twentieth century. Following a review of the nation's beginnings and the impact of the Enlightenment on U.S. democratic ideals, students build upon the tenth grade study of global industrialization to understand the emergence and impact of new technology and a corporate economy, including the social and cultural effects. They trace the change in the ethnic composition of American society; the movement toward equal rights for racial minorities and women; and the role of the United States as a major world power. An emphasis is placed on the expanding role of the federal government and federal courts as well as the continuing tension between the individual and the state. Students consider the major social problems of our time and trace their causes in historical events. They learn that the United States has served as a model for other nations and that the rights and freedoms we enjoy are not accidents, but the results of a defined set of political principles that are not always basic to citizens of other countries. Students understand that our rights under the U.S. Constitution are a precious inheritance that depends on an educated citizenry for their preservation and protection.

Notebooks will be checked periodically and these checks will not be announced.  All class notes and assignments should be included, even for the days you were absent.  This includes each being recorded in the table of contents.  Each right side assignment must be complete, have a heading, and the date assigned or given written on it.  Mostly it is checked on being complete but the left sides must be varied and not be a simple restatement or a picture with no processing of content from the right side.

The interactive notebooks encourage students to record information in an organized fashion.  We divide the notebooks into two different sides: left side activities and right side activities.  The right side of the notebook is the “input” side or the teacher side.  It contains the key information for the unit such as class notes, t-charts, and graphs.  Typically, all “testable” information will be found here.  The left side of the notebook is the “output” side or the student side, primarily used for processing new ideas.  Students work out an understanding of the material by using illustrations, diagrams, or flow charts.  Students explore their opinions and clarify values on issues, wonder about “what if” hypothetical situations and ask questions about new ideas. These activities will either PREVIEW or PROCESS new information.
If you are absent, it is your responsibility to obtain notebook assignments from either a classmate or the teacher.

Interactive notebooks will be used for class notes, as well as for other activities where you will be asked to express your own ideas and process information presented by this class.

This notebook is different from traditional notebooks due to the fact that it provides activities of a variety of learning styles, mixture of the Multiple Intelligences, and tasks all geared to how our brains learn best.  This notebook will be a valuable resource in preparing for tests.  The notebook is 30% of your entire grade.

- 3 Subject spiral bound notebook (8.5 x 11, college ruled)
Students study major turning points that shaped the modern world, from the late eighteenth century through the present, including the cause and course of the two world wars. They trace the rise of democratic ideas and develop an understanding of the historical roots of current world issues, especially as they pertain to international relations. They extrapolate from the American experience that democratic ideals are often achieved at a high price, remain vulnerable and are not practiced everywhere in the world. Students develop an understanding of current world issues and relate them to their historical, geographic, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Students consider multiple accounts of events in order to understand international relations from a variety of perspectives.

If you need a letter of recommendation from a school staff member for a college application, scholarship, or program application, please complete the form below and give it to them along with a copy of your transcript and your extra-curricular activities resume. You must give them at least 2 weeks to write the letter (not including breaks/holidays), because these things tend to be seasonal and teachers are often asked to write them for several students. Please have a conversation with the teacher regarding what the letter is needed for and which of your attributes they should focus the letter on. It may feel like bragging, but understanding what exactly you need in the letter will really help the teacher give you the best recommendation possible.  Always remember to thank them for their time for doing this for you.
Students who have a test score and are applying to test optional schools should consider the policies and admissions statistics of the school before deciding to submit those scores. Your counselor or the College & Career Center staff is available to assist students with this decision.
At this time (school year 2024-2025) it is the recommendation of Rocklin High School that students continue to attempt to take the SAT and/or ACT to provide for as many possible opportunities for college admissions and financial aid as possible if it is reasonable for them to do so, however they should rest assured that many great opportunities are available without test scores this year.

Participation make ups are offered Tuesdays-Fridays during Flex time, meet at the designated location by 10:25 dressed and ready to participate.
Specific Assignment make-ups can be completed by appointment with your teacher or during Flex time.                (ex. Written tests, skills tests, lab activities…)

It is the goal of the RHS Physical Education Department to keep students actively involved whenever possible and appropriate.  Goal number  one is the health and safety of of the student.  Students who are unable to participate due to injury or illness will not earn daily participation points.  Prompt and clear communication between Parent/Physician and Teacher is important.  If the Doctor specifically allows it, most activities can be  modified allowing students to remain engaged at an appropriate level until they can return to full participation.  Not all activites can be modified for all circumstances.  Not all modifications requested are available.  When in doubt, please email your P.E. teacher.  In the event the a student cannot participate they will have the opportunity to earn the points they missed during Flex Period PE Make-Ups for the duration of the current semester.
