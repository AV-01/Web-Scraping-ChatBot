2021 -22 School Accountability Report Card  
General Information about the School Accountability Report Card (SARC)  
SARC Overview  
 By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. 
Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies 
(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), 
which describes how they intend to meet annual school -specific goals for all pupils, 
with s pecific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data 
reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.  
For more information about SARC requirements and access to prior year reports, 
see the California Departme nt of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/  
For more information about the LCFF or the LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page 
at www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/  
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community 
members should contact the  school principal or the district office.  
DataQuest  
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/  that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is 
a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropou ts, course enrollments, staffing, and data 
regarding English learners).  
California School Dashboard  
 The California School Dashboard (Dashboard) www.caschooldashboard.org/  
reflects California’s new accountability and continuous improvement system and 
provides information about how LEAs and schools are meeting the needs of 
California’s diverse student population. The Dashboard contains reports that 
display the performance of  LEAs, schools, and student groups on a set of state 
and local measures to assist in identifying strengths, challenges, and areas in 
need of improvement.  
Internet Access  Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are public ly 
accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and 
public locations is generally provided on a first -come, first -served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a wor kstation 
may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available 
on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

2021 -22 School Overview  
Rocklin Community – The suburban city of Rocklin lies twenty miles northeast of Sacramento. It has a population of 63,000. 
Rocklin has an estimated civilian work force of 30,100 with an unemployment rate of 4.4%, and a median household income of 
$82,805. Approximately 40% of Rocklin citizens over  age 25 hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.  
Rocklin High School is one of two four -year comprehensive high schools within the Rocklin Unified School District. The current 
enrollment is 2049 students. The academic year is based on two semesters, each appro ximately 18 weeks in length. Rocklin 
High School is on an eight period rotating block schedule with a 30 -minute student support period.  
Grading and Graduation Requirements – Rocklin High School uses both a weighted (5.0) and unweighted (4.0) grading scale . 
Our educational philosophy rests on the belief that all students will master the learning associated with the common set of 
standards in each course. Because of this, we do not issue letter grades of “D” or “F.” Any student earning below a 70% in a 
cours e or who has not demonstrated mastery will not receive credit “NC” and will need to retake the course if it is required for 
graduation. Our course requirements for graduation are as follows:  
Language Arts       4 years  Foreign Language 1 year  
Science                 3 years  Technology         1 year  
Social Science 3.5 years  Visual/Perf. Arts 1 year  
Math                 3 years  Health                 1 semester  
Physical Education 3 years  Elective                 5 years  
In addition to these course req uirements, students must complete a minimum of 25 hours of documented community service. 
The average student completed 80 hours and 20% of the students in the class of 2018 completed 150+ hours and were 
recognized for their distinguished service. Together,  the class of 2019 performed 36,410 hours of community service work.  
Matriculation - On average, 92% of our graduates seek post -secondary education immediately after graduation. 51% 
matriculate to 4 -year, degree -granting institutions, 40% to community col lege, and 1% attend tech or trade schools.  
Rocklin High School offers advanced, honors and Advanced Placement (AP) level courses. AP courses are typically not offered
Rocklin High School offers advanced, honors and Advanced Placement (AP) level courses. AP courses are typically not offered 2021 -22 School Accountability Report Card  Page 3 of 24 Rocklin High School  2021 -22 School Overview  
to freshmen and only a few are available to sophomores. Our transcripts reflect a weigh ted grade for honors and AP courses, 
but not for advanced courses even though they are considerably more rigorous than the standard version of the same course. 
Approximately 68% of students take AP classes while at Rocklin High School and those who do aver age 4 -5 AP classes. Our 
counseling department recommends that students take no more than 3 advanced, honors or AP courses in a given school 
year.  
Mission Statement  
Rocklin High School is an established, exceptional educational institution. Our mission is  to empower each student to become 
a dynamic, life -long learner, positioned to succeed in a global community. Our collaborative and innovative system is 
distinguished by a creative learning environment that supports the physical, intellectual and emotional  needs of each individual.

 2021 -22 School Accountability Report Card  Page 6 of 24 Rocklin High School  School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements  
School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements  
Our campus facilities and grounds are designed to provide for the safety of our students.  Permanent buildings and 
relocatables were built in three pha ses from 1992 – 1998.  The custodial, maintenance, and grounds crews operate together to 
keep the campus clean and well maintained. In the summer of 2010 the District Office and RUSD Board of Trustees added 
synthetic turf to our stadium; reconstructed our tennis courts and improved our blacktop area.  in the summer of 2012 staff re -
roofed and replaced 6 HVAC units above the locker/team/offices at the gym building.  
On a daily basis, the campus is supervised by the discipline staff (discipline technicians, and administrators).  They monitor the 
single public access route into the campus, the parking lot, and the school grounds during ingress and egress.  During the 
school day, our discipline staff, support staff, and teachers supervise the campu s and address issues, which include 
introducing ourselves to unrecognized adults and directing them to the office to gain access. Four days a week a school 
resource officer from the Rocklin Police Department is on campus. When students’ behaviors violate t he safety of the campus, 
they are referred to administration.  Consequences are assigned according to California State Education Code and RUSD 
Discipline Guidelines.  In 2010 -11, handicapped parking accessibility throughout all parking lots on the RHS camp us were 
updated to meet current code. In the summer of 2011 the soccer field and all parking areas were upgraded.  
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d istrict uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  District maintenance 
ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner .  
A wor k order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes  State Priority: Pupil Achievement  
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):  
Statewide Assessments  
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in 
the gene ral education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] 
for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs . CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement 
standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities).  
The CAASPP System encompasses the following assessments and student  
participation requirements:  
1. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for ELA  in grades 
three through eight and grade eleven.  
2. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for mathematics  
in grades three through eight and grade eleven.  
3. California  Science Test (CAST) and CAAs for Science  in grades five, eight, 
and once in high school (i.e., grade ten, eleven, or twelve).  
SARC Reporting in the 2020 -2021 School Year Only  
Where the most viable option, LEAs were required to administer the statewide 
summative assessment in ELA and mathematics. Where a statewide summative 
assessment was not the most viable option for the LEA (or for one or more grade -
level[s] within the LEA) due to the pandemic, LEAs were allowed to report results 
from a different asses sment that met the criteria established by the State Board of 
Education (SBE) on March 16, 2021. The assessments were required to be:  
• Aligned with CA CCSS for ELA and mathematics;  
• Available to students in grades 3 through 8, and grade 11; and  
• Uniformly administered across a grade, grade span, school, or district to all 
eligible students.  
Options  
Note that the CAAs could only be administered in -person following health and 
safety requirements. If it was not viable for the LEA to administer the C AAs in 
person with health and safety guidelines in place, the LEA was directed to not 
administer the tests. There were no other assessment options available for the 
CAAs. Schools administered the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
ELA and mathemati cs, other assessments that meet the SBE criteria, or a 
combination of both, and they could only choose one of the following:  
• Smarter Balanced ELA and mathematics summative assessments;  
• Other assessments meeting the SBE criteria; or  
• Combination of Smarter Balanced ELA and mathematics summative 
assessments and other assessments.

Percentage of Students Meeting or Exceeding the State Standard on CAASPP  
This table displays CAASPP test results in ELA and mathematics for all students grades three through eight and grade eleven 
taking and completing a state -administered assessment.  
The 2019 -2020 data cells with N/A values indicate that the 2019 -2020 data are not available due to the COVID -19 pandemi c and 
resulting summative test suspension. The Executive Order N -30-20 was issued which waived the assessment, accountability, and 
reporting requirements for the 2019 -2020 school year.  
The 2020 -2021 data cells have N/A values because these data are not co mparable to other year data due to the COVID -19 
pandemic during the 2020 -2021 school year. Where the CAASPP assessments in ELA and/or mathematics is not the most viable 
option, the LEAs were allowed to administer local assessments. Therefore, the 2020 -2021  data between school years for the 
school, district, state are not an accurate comparison. As such, it is inappropriate to compare results of the 2020 -2021 school year 
to other school years.

2020 -21 Career Technical Education Programs  
All courses in the Academic Planning Guide are designed to meet graduation standards. Students and counselors work 
together to prepare for graduation.  Approximately 90% of the core classes and 75% of the elective classes meet UC/CSU 
entrance requirements. Effectiveness of these programs is based on assessment and  demonstrations in the classroom. RHS 
evaluates its program effectiveness on student placement in schools and programs after graduation (e.g.: 2 + 2 articulations 
with our local community college and student performances at universities and colleges).The c ounseling staff and the middle 
school counselors, developed a comprehensive six year plan for our students. We believe it is important for secondary student s 
(beginning in 7th grade) to plan for their high school graduation. With guidance from the counselo rs, we assure that each 
student is aware of and has equitable access to all programs. We work hard to provide students with an understanding and 
practice for “real world” experiences ranging from ROP to incorporating SCANS in the classroom. RHS provides pr ograms in:

 2021 -22 School Accountability Report Card  Page 17 of 24 Rocklin High School  2021 -22 School Safety Plan  
2021 -22 School Safety Plan  
Rocklin High School has developed a comprehensive plan that addresses a variety of crisis situations.  The school fosters 
awareness, preparedness, and school safety through regularly scheduled safety drills, as well as training for students and st aff.  
Our school site employs a f ull time School Resource Officer (SRO) who works closely with the site and the district to ensure our 
campus remains a safe environment.  The RHS Crisis Response team reviews safety related issues and reports, then plans 
prevention, intervention, and post -intervention activities with students, parents and teachers in a comprehensive school safety 
plan.  The school safety plan will be reviewed at the February 2021 Site Council Meeting and approved by the school site 
council and board.  
All students at Rockli n High School are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, cooperation, 
courtesy and acceptance of others.  All students should be provided the opportunity to experience positive and worthwhile 
learning experiences on the s chool campus.  The goal of the Rocklin High School discipline program is to help educate and 
support our students by providing clear boundaries and expectations for personal behavior in social, academic and 
professional settings.  Students and parents are informed of the discipline policies via the school website, student planners, 
class meetings and discipline talks from administration at the beginning of each school year.  In addition, daily announcemen ts, 
the school website, computerized voice messages, e-mails and social media provide both students and parents with regular 
communication.  RHS utilizes a progressive discipline process in order to produce a desired change in student behavior, 
attitude and/or performance.  Consequences for violations of the  disciplinary policy may include warnings, detention, class 
suspension, on -campus suspension, off -campus suspension, parent conference, Saturday School, behavior contract, transfer 
to an alternative program or expulsion.   Our school attendance office call s parents daily to report student class absences and 
our parents receive quarter and semester grade reports by mail.  Parents can also access student grades online through 
Schoology.  
The Suspensions and Expulsions table illustrates total cases for the las t three years.  Suspensions are shown in terms of total 
infractions, not number of students suspended.  As often as possible, administration utilizes our On -Campus Suspension room 
in order to keep students at school and current with their studies.  Expulsi ons occur when required by law or when all other 
alternatives are exhausted.

Local Accountability Report Card (LARC) Addendum  
2020 -21 Local Accountability Report 
Card (LARC) Addendum Overview  
 On July 14, 2021, the California State Board of Education (SBE) determined that 
the California Department of Education (CDE) will use the SARC as the mechanism 
to conduct a one -time data collection of the LEA -level aggregate test results of all 
school’s local assessments administered during the 2020 –2021 school year in 
order to meet the federal Every Students Succeeds Act (ESSA) reporting 
requirement for the Local Educational Agency Accountability Report Cards 
(LARCs).  
Each local educational agency (LEA) is responsible for preparing and posting their 
annual LARC in accordance with the federal ESSA. As a courtesy, the CDE 
prepares and posts the LARCs on behalf of all LEAs.  
Only for the 2020 –2021 school year and the 2020 –2021 LARCs, LEAs are required 
to report their aggregate local assessments test results at the LEA -level to the CDE 
by populating the tables below via the SARC. These data will be used to meet the 
LEAs’ federal requirement for their LARCs. Note that it is the responsibility of the 
school and LEA to ensure that all student privacy and suppression rules are in 
place when reporting data in Tables 3 and 4 in the  Addendum, as applicable.  
The tables below are not part of the SBE approved 2020 –2021 SARC template but 
rather are the mechanism by which these required data will be collected from LEAs.  
For purposes of the LARC and the following tables, an LEA is define d as a school 
district, a county office of education, or a direct funded charter school.

ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION  
Rocklin Unified School District offers several alternative programs for students and ad ults to complete their 
education.  These programs are planned to help individuals earn a high school diploma or prepare for t he General 
Education Diploma (GED ).   
Victory High School  is a continuation high school program.  Victory High School is WASC accr edited and 
recognized by the State of California as a Model Continuation School.  Victory provides students a smaller 
academic setting to reach their goals of a high school diploma as well as planning for their future.  The continuation 
education staff foc uses on student -centered instruction that provides pathways for a diverse student population to 
acquire the skills of the core curriculum.  The continuation staff continually assesses the personal and academic 
needs of students and makes appropriate adjust ments.  Classes at Victory are no larger than 18 students (with a total 
student population ranging from 80 -120).  Students earn credit through a time on task model which emphasizes 
strong attendance and participation.  A diploma from Victory High School al lows students access to all community 
colleges, most trade schools and access to the military.  Due to smaller class sizes and more individualized attention, 
students are able to see success both in the classroom and in the school environment.  Students in terested in 
attending this program should meet with their high school counselor first.  The program offers a curriculum that is 
personalized and contains work study and work experience components as well.  In order to graduate from Victory 
High School, stu dents must earn 200 credits in specified areas.  Qualifications for enrollment are that you are a 
Junior or Senior and at least 16 years of age.  Please note: this program does not meet the UC/CSU A -G eligibility 
requirements.  Please visit website for fur ther information: http://vhs.rocklinusd.org/ .  
Rocklin Independent Charter Academy (RICA)  is an accredited K -12 school that strives to meet the growing 
needs of students by preparing them for a career and colleg e by offering a 3 Tier blended school model. Teachers 
use a combination of direct classroom instruction, on -line courses and independent study to build an educational 
plan to meet the needs of every student.   RICA offers blended courses through the use of  Schoology in all subject 
areas such as English, math, history, science, art, health, and electives. These courses are taught using a wide range 
of resources from textbooks, videos, interactive lessons, and other supplementary materials. Students are engag ed in 
the materials through assignments, forums, journals, tests, quizzes, and surveys.  
We also offer traditional online courses through a curriculum based program called OdysseyWare.  All rigorous and 
relevant course work is completed online at home or at school to meet the same requirement as our direct instruction 
classes.  In addition, some students also attend small direct instruction classes in math and English as well as science 
labs.  Students meet with teachers in traditional group settings and r eceive teacher led instruction, participate in 
active conversations around texts, and collaborate on extended learning projects.    All student work is monitored by 
highly qualified credentialed teachers who meet weekly with students to review, correct, pro ctor and instruct in 
person.    If students find they need more help, we provide tutoring.  
The unique design of RICA gives students a voice in their own educational goals. This voice leads to an ownership 
in personal academic achievement and a more positiv e learning experience which in turn helps them find success in 
future career or college of choices.  
RICA students have the opportunity to enroll in Associated Student Body (ASB). This course is designed to give 
students the opportunity for active partici pation in student leadership. Working with an advisor, students plan and 
conduct social activities for the school student population while learning about government procedures and earning 
elective or government credits.  
Rocklin Independent Charter Academy  is a Western Association of Schools and Colleges/WASC accredited school 
which offers California State Standards Based Curriculum for students in grades K -12 culminating with a high 
school diploma. The RICA curriculum and instruction is tailored to meet th e individual needs of its students 
providing choice, variety and flexibility. A variety of curriculum delivery options designed for charter school 
students is available. RICA is a blended model school with the support of a tutoring, intensive intervention,  direct 
instruction, technology, electives, and college preparation coursework. Student assessment and performance is
instruction, technology, electives, and college preparation coursework. Student assessment and performance is instructed and supervised by fully credentialed teachers.  The School’s founders believe that a well -educated person 
in the 21st century p ossesses the knowledge and skills to succeed as affective citizens, workers, and leaders. They 
should be able to see connections so as to be able to make sense of the world and act within it in creative ways to 
purposely communicate, problem solve and an d isseminate information.   
The program is located on the Rocklin Alternative Education Center campus  and is open to all students regardless of 
district of residence .  RICA requires students  to earn 200 credits in specific subject areas to graduate. Please note, 
this program does not currently meet the UC/CSU A – G requirements for Science and Foreign Language only.

General Educat ion Diploma (GED ) is an option available through Roseville Adult Education and is the equivalent 
to a high school diploma in California.  A certificate is awarded when each of the five timed tests in different subject 
areas is passed.  The subject tests in clude:  Writing, Social Studies, Science, Interpreting Literature and th e Arts, and 
Mathematics.  The GED  may be taken by a California resident or a member of the armed forces assigned to this 
state who meets any one of the following criteria:  
 Candidate is  18 years of age or older within 60 days of his/her birthday.  
 Candidate is no longer in school, but had he/she remained in school, it is within 60 days of when his/her 
class would have graduated.  
 Candidate is 17 years, 10 months of age and has been out of  school for at least 60 consecutive days, and 
he/she can provide a letter of request for the test from the military, a post -secondary educational institution, 
or a prospective employer.  
 Candidate is 17 years of age and began the GED  test battery while inca rcerated in a California state or 
county correctional facility.  
California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE)  is an equivalency option provided by the State Department of 
Education.  Each person who passes the CHSPE is awarded a Certificate of Proficien cy, which is equivalent by law 
in the state of California  to a high school diploma.  In this case, the high school does not issue a diploma . 
The CHSPE may be taken by persons who are 16 years or older on the day of the exam.  Persons who are younger 
than 16 may also take the test if they have completed a year of enrollment in the 10th grade or will complete a year 
of enrollment in the 10th grade at the end of the semester in which the next regular test date falls.  Passing the test 
does not exempt a studen t from required school attendance unless the examinee has also reached his/her 16th 
birthday and has presented verified parental permission.  The CHSPE is given two times each year, once in April 
and once in November.  Results are mailed to the school and the student approximately 5 – 6 weeks after the testing 
date.

ADVANCED PLACEMENT(AP)/ HONOR S(H)/ADVANCED 
COURSES  
Advanced  Placement/Honors /Advanced  courses are provided for the highly 
motivated  academic student who meets  the prerequisites to enroll.  Students who 
do not meet the prerequisites may speak directly with the teacher to discuss the 
possibility of a waiver to enrol l in the class .  The AP Program offers several AP 
Scholar Awards to recognize high school students who have demonstrated college -
level achievement through AP courses and exams.  In addition to receiving an 
award certificate, this achievement is acknowledge d on any AP Grade Report that 
is sent to colleges the following fall.  For additional information regarding AP 
Scholar Awards, please visit the following website:  
http:// www. collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/scholarawards.html .   
Students should plan carefully when taking Honors and AP courses.  These classes 
are taught in an accelerated format comparable to that of a university level course; 
therefore, they require extens ive out -of-class work.  Please consider this 
information when selecting classes.  Students are given three weeks after school 
begins to drop an AP /Honors/Advanced  class if they find the class is too 
difficult.   A student is given the first semester to mai ntain appropriate level quality 
work.  If he/she does not maintain that level, he/she will be moved to a similar 
class at a lower level at the semester only.  
Advanced Placement exams are administered in May.  Students are subject to an 
exam  fee which is c harged by the College Board.  Reduced fee applications, due to 
financial hardship, are available in the Counseling Center.  Many colleges award 
credit and/or advanced placement for demonstrated subject area proficiency  (to 
research  a specific college’s pol icy, please visit 
https://apscore.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search -credit -policies ). 
 Please note that universities will not consider awarding credit unles s the AP exam 
is taken and passed.   All AP exam fees must be made by February 1st.  Students 
may pay for exams in the Student Store.  
Although students are not limited to a specific number of AP/Honors /Advanced  
courses they may take, it is the recommendat ion of the school that students design 
their six year plan so that no more than three  AP/Honors /Advanced  courses  are 
taken in any given year.

CSU -UC Comparison of Minimum Requirements  
 California State University (CSU)  University of California (UC)  
TEST SCORES – ACT/SAT  
 Test required for CSU applicants to 
impacted campuses and for applicants to 
non-impacted campuses, who have earned 
an “a -g” GPA of less than a 3.0. CSU 
combines best critical reading and math 
scores from multiple sittings of SAT; may 
combine best subscores from ACT to 
calculate best composite.  The ACT plus Writing or the SAT Reasoning 
Test is required for UC applicants.  UC uses 
the highest c omposite  score from a singl e 
sitting of the ACT plus Writing or the SAT 
Reasoning Test.  Some campuses  may 
recommend SAT Subject Tests for specific 
majors.  
VALIDATION OF SUBJECT REQUIREMENTS BY OTHER COURSES  
Mathematics  A grade of C or better in the second semester of a mathematic s course validates a D/F in the 
first semester.  A grade of C or better in the first semester of Algebra II validates both 
semesters of Algebra I.  A grade of C or better in Trigonometry/Pre -Calc validates the entire 
high school preparatory requirement wit h the exception of Geometry.  A grade of C or better 
in statistics will validate only Algebra I and II, not Geometry.  
Language Other than English  
(LOTE)  A grade of C or better in a higher -level course validates a lower -level course .  A higher level 
LOTE c ourse can validate the appropriate number of years based on the level.  A college 
course can validate a high school LOTE course.  The level of validation depends on the 
college course prerequisite and description.   Refer to the CCC “a -g” course list and re view 
the “Category” column.  
Chemistry  A grade of C or better in the second 
semester of chemistry will validate a D in 
the first semester.  A grade of C or better in the second semester 
of chemistry will not validate a D in the first 
semester.  UC does not allow the validation 
of Chemistry.  
VALIDATION OF D GRADES IN REQUIRED COURSES  
 Courses in which grades of D/F are earned may be validated in the areas of Math and 
Language Other Than English by successful completion of higher level coursework.***  
VALIDA TION OF SUBJECT REQUIREMENTS BY TEST SCORES  
 Required “a -g” courses may be satisfied with appropriate test scores on SAT Subject Tests, 
Advanced Placement exams, and designated IB exams.  A list of acceptable tests and scores 
is available on the UC and CS U websites.  
REPEATED COURSES  
 Required “a -g” courses must completed with a grade of C or better.  Courses in which grades 
D/F are earned may be repeated.  The highest grade will be used in the grade calculation.  
 UC only allows a course to be repeated one 
time for grade replacement.  
HIGH SCHOOL GPA  
 Calculate GPA using only “A -G” approved courses taken after 9th grade  (with the exception 
of Cal Poly)  including summer courses .  All “A -G” courses must be reported.

rhs.rocklinusd.org_documents_Purchase Requisitions
Purchase Requisitions:  “Not to Exceed ”and Open  
Standard Protocol:   Purchase Requisitions are submitted for specifically identified items  with specific dollar amounts  that have 
been researched and need to include sales tax and shipping.   
 Ex.)  200 shirts @ $4.00 per shirt sub-totaled @    $800.00  
      Tax @8.25%   $ 66.00  
      Shipping @ 10%  $ 80.00  
      Total    $946.00  
Not to Exceed (NTE) Exceptions:   Purchase Requisitions may be submitted for specifically identified items  with an estimate d 
dollar amount .  With the items listed you can estimate the amount needed and state it as an amount “not to exceed ” (NTE) a certain dollar 
value.   You need to be sure that your NTE amount includes tax and shipping, hence the $1,000 below for the 200 shirt s. 
 Ex.)  200 shirts NTE $10 00.00  
Open Purchase Requisition  Exceptions:  
1. Open Purchase Requisition for a Specific Purpose:   If you have an event coming up or specific category of needs that you 
will be purchasing multiple things for at multiple places you can submit an open purchase requisition  with you as the 
vendor.  You would buy the items then submit receipts to June for reimbursement based on the requisition having already 
been appr oved.  These ope n P.O.’s should not exceed $2 50 and would not be open for more than sixty days.   If you have a 
need that would exceed this dollar amount see John Thompson or Mark Douglas for approval prior to submitting the 
requisition for the Business Mee ting.   
Ex.)  NTE $250  for Dance Show supplies  
Ex.)  NTE $250  for audio/video supplies  
2. Open Purchase Requisition for a Non -Specific Purpose:   If you find yourself constantly needing to go out and buy an array 
of  random non-specific items  that would not be  able to be classified under a  specific heading  you can submit an open 
purchase requisition with you as the vendor.  You would buy the items then submit receipts to June for reimbursement 
based on the requisition having already been approved.  These open P.O.s should  not exceed $10 0. and would not be 
open for more than sixty days.    
Ex.)  NTE $10 0 for miscellaneous supplies during the season  
 An example of this would be:  The cheer program buys batteries for a microphone, bobby pins, 
hair ties, safety pins, shoe glue, a dowel for their flag, etc.   None are in large enough quantity 
to warrant their own specific open P.O. yet are still valid needs of the program and would be 
extremely cumbersome to submit a separate requisition for each item.  
General Rule of T humb:   Requisitions should be as specific as possible.  Open Purchase Orders are the exception to the rule and 
should not be used as the normal procedure.  Any items of any significant dollar amount should be submitted as its own requisition.   
Exception to the rule : If a PO is very specific in vendor, purpose and timeframe, the PO may remain open dependent on conversation with 
bookkeeper.  
 Ex.) Cheer PO to vendor Varsity for “2016 Team Uniforms”. Pay first invoice for Varsity and JV uniforms 8/25/16, sec ond invoice 
dependent on Frosh tryouts and how many girls make the team. Second invoice to be obtained by 9/30/16.  
 Ex.2)  Junior Prom deposit and paid in increments. Documentation provides dates that specific amounts are due by.

EXPECTATIONS  
Attendance at school is compulsory until the 18th birthday or graduation from high school. Students 
are expected to be in class on time daily in orde r to receive maximum benefits from the instructional 
program.  
■ A student is considered absent from class if they miss 30+ minutes of a class period.

■ Attendance procedures must be followed even after the student’s 18th birthday.  
SENIOR ATTENDANCE POLICY  
Students must maintain a minimum 90% attendance during eac h semester of their senior year in 
order to participate in Senior Activities. This includes all absences, whether excused or unexcused, 
and off campus suspensions. Field trips, school activities, and any tardy will not affect this record.  
The Senior Class  Administrator discusses the details of the Senior Attendance Policy during the 
Discipline Talks within the first few weeks of the fall semester.  
CLEARING ABSENCES  
1. Verification of absences is to be made by a phone call, a note or email from a parent/guardian

Telephone calls should be made the same day as the absence to  916 -632 -1600 #6103.  
2. Failure to clear an absence by a telephone call, note or email within three (3) days will be marked 
as truant and result in disciplinary action . 
3. Rocklin Unified School District authorizes certain absences to be classified as "excused" if they

ACADEMIC GUIDELINES  
MASTERY LEARNING AND GRADUATION OVERVIEW  
The system of education at RHS is driven by performance –based standards as mandated by the State 
of California and the Rocklin Unified School District. Standards are not new to education; educators 
have always set goals and expected levels of achievement f or students.  At Rocklin High School, we go 
beyond expectations by requiring all students to master the learning associated with the common set 
of standards. In support of this philosophy, the curriculum, instruction, assessment, and reporting 
to parents i s designed accordingly.  
■ Students will demonstrate mastery of the content standards through coursework and 
assessments aligned with National, California and district standards. The grade reporting system 
is used to communicate a student’s progress toward m astery. By requiring students to master 
academic standards, a graduate will have the skills and knowledge needed for success in whatever 
post -high school avenues are chosen.  
■ In addition to course requirements, RHS graduates are required to possess and demo nstrate 
mastery of our Departmental Objectives, Essential Skills and Concepts. Graduation will be based 
upon demonstrations of what students actually know. At RHS, only after a student has 
demonstrated that learning has occurred will RHS confirm that educa tion has happened. A 
minimum of 250 credits, including the required subjects below, must be earned in grades 9 –12 in 
order to meet graduation requirements.

GRADING POLICY AND SYSTEM  
Grades are maintained and readily available online at http://rhs.rocklinusd.org/ for students, parents, 
and teachers to monitor and discuss student achievement. Three options are available:  
1. Students and parents can view grades through  Schoology. If your family does not already have an 
existing account, please email the Principal's Secretary, Bridget Hopper @ 
bhopper@rocklinusd.org . On the homepage of the school’s website, select the “Schoology” tab 
and follow the instructions. New Schoology accounts must be activated via our school’s website 
(this can take 24 -48 hours after a student’s first day) . 
2. Weekly Grade Check Forms for students to take to their teachers can be printed from the school’s 
website by selecting the ‘Info’ tab, ‘Counseling’ and ‘Weekly Grade Check Form’.  
3. Parents are welcome to email or phone teachers to request grade -related inform ation.   
Semester grades carry final credit, are considered permanent grades, and become part of the official 
school record (transcript) for each student.

ROCKLIN HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY  
Teachers, parents, and students all play an important role in creating an academic community that 
promotes the lear ning and ethical development of all Rocklin High School students. To help ensure 
the success of all our students during and after high school, Rocklin High School has an Academic 
Integrity Code governed by policies focused on educating all students on Acad emic Integrity. 
Academic dishonesty is contrary to the fundamental purpose of a school and proven violations will 
not be tolerated. Cheating is not open to interpretation by anyone other than the teacher of that 
class. Therefore, if a student has questions  about what is acceptable conduct on any assignment, it 
is the student’s and parent’s responsibility to ask clarifying questions prior to the assignment being 
submitted for evaluation. Failure to uphold this responsibility could be considered a violation o f the 
Academic Integrity Code which will be supported and tracked by the Administration.  For students 
who violate the Academic Integrity Code for the first time, the aim is to further educate the student
who violate the Academic Integrity Code for the first time, the aim is to further educate the student  
to prevent a repeat violation of the code.  Academic  Integrity Violations are tracked throughout all 
four years of high school and carry over from year to year.   
Generalized examples of academic misconduct include:  
■ Receiving or providing unauthorized assistance on examinations or formal assessments  
■ Using or having unauthorized materials or electronic devices out during an examination  
■ Plagiarism:  
○ Taking or using someone else's work/product or ideas and passing them o ff as one's 
own  
○ Using materials from sources without citations or clear attempts to cite the original 
source  
■ Taking an exam or writing a paper as a surrogate or by a surrogate  
■ The unauthorized sharing of or using information by means of digital, written, or verbal 
communication to assist a student in circumventing the skill being assessed during a 
formative or summative assessment.  
■ The unauthorized altering of an exam and submitting it for re -grading  
■ Fabricating data or references  
It is important to remin d students and parents that these are generalized examples and that any 
conduct that the teacher interprets as fitting one or more of the above violations will be 
considered an infringement of the Academic Integrity Code. Students have the responsibility t o 
think carefully about their approach to completing an assignment and need to provide evidence of 
their process. If the student feels, beforehand, that his/her approach to completing an assignment 
may be interpreted as one or more of the examples above, t he student is expected to clarify their 
approach with the teacher prior to completing the assignment for final assessment. Ignorance of 
the Academic Integrity Policy or the teacher's expectations is not a valid argument in defense of a 
violation. Therefore , the above examples of Academic misconduct are always implied expectations 
unless modified by the teacher.  
Academic Integrity Referral Process:  
The teacher will submit a referral to the RHS Administration with evidence of the Academic 
Integrity Violatio n.  The teacher and administration will then coordinate on contacting the parents 
regarding the violation.  
1st Offense:

child care centers, and family child care homes to enforce immunization requirements, maintain 
immunization records of all children enrolled, and submit reports to the loc al health department.

payment plan with M s. Miller  prior to the February 1st deadline . The College Board 
provides a fee reduction plan for students that qualify.   Students ma y visit the Counseling 
Center for additional information.
Center for additional information.   
 Topic Information  
Since the course is tested by College Board, the exhaustive explanation  can be found at the 
College Board website: www.collegeboard. org.  Perform a search f or “AP Chemistry Course 
and Exam Description ”. 
This year, we are going to treat AP Chemistry as a „2nd year‟ chemistry course, so we will move 
quickly over topics that were already covered in General Chemistry.  
Changes  
The 2013 -2014 year is now AP Chemistry‟s turn for a course revision. The revisions are 
designed to have a balance between breadth and depth of knowledge.  In addition, there are 
now 117 Learning Objectives that „detail‟ out what students must know, or be able to do . Each 
exam question is tied directly to one or more Learning Objectives (L.O.‟s) .   
As such, this year we will try something new and implement Essential Skills .  These Essential 
Skills will be the Learning Objectives . Since this is the first year, and th ere are so many 
Learning Objectives, this policy will be implemented with a great deal of flexibility.  Every one 
of the unit test questions will be tied to an L.O. So passing the test with a 70% means that 
students are 70% proficient on the Learning Objec tives, and therefore Essential Skills.  
Essential Skills will be introduce d at the beginning of each unit.  
Six Big Ideas  
The revisions to the AP Chemistry course have resulted in the differentiation of six Big Ideas, 
and they are called as such.  The Big  Ideas are divided into Enduring Understandings  and 
Essential Knowledge,  and then are split up even further into the Learning Objectives.  
Additionally, there are Science Practices which are designed to encourage the building of more 
skills in the classroo m.  The following are the 6 Big Ideas:  
 Big Idea 1 : The chemical elements are fundamental building materials of matter, and all 
matter can be understo od in terms of arrangements of atoms. These atoms re tain their 
identity in chemical reactions . 
 Big Idea 2: Chemical and physical properties  of materials can be explained by the 
structure and the arrangement of  atoms, ions, or molecules and the forces between 
them . 
 Big Idea 3 : Changes in matter involve the rearr angement and/or reorganization of atoms 
and/or the transfer of electrons.  
 Big Idea 4 : Rates of chemical reactions ar e determined by details of the molecular 
collisions . 
 Big Idea 5 : The laws of thermodynamics describe the essential role  of energy and 
explain and predict the direction of changes in mat ter. 
 Big Idea 6 : Any bond or intermolecular attrac tion that can be formed can be broken. 
These two processes are in a dyn amic competition, sensitive to initial conditions and 
external perturbations .

AP Environmental Science (APES) Course Syllabus
Course Instructors:
Period 1: Mr. Kimmel (wkimmel@rocklin.k12.ca.us), Room G1
Period 7: Mr. Marjama (gmarjama@rocklin.k12.ca.us), Room G2
Course Description:
The goal of the AP Environmental Science course is to provide students with the scientific principles,
concepts, and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships of the natural world, to
identify and analyze environmental problems both natural and human-made, to evaluate the relative
risks associated with these problems, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving and/or
preventing them.
Environmental science is interdisciplinary; it embraces a wide variety of topics from different areas
of study. Yet there are several major unifying constructs, or themes, that cut across the many topics
included in the study of environmental science. The following themes provide a foundation for the
structure of the AP Environmental Science course.
1.Science is a process.
●Science is a method of learning more about the world.
●Science constantly changes the way we understand the world.
2.Energy conversions underlie all ecological processes.
●Energy cannot be created; it must come from somewhere.
●As energy flows through systems, at each step more of it becomes unusable.
3.The Earth itself is one interconnected system.
●Natural systems change over time and space.
●Biogeochemical systems vary in ability to recover from disturbances.
4.Humans alter natural systems.
●Humans have had an impact on the environment for millions of years.
●Technology and population growth have enabled humans to increase both the rate
and scale of their impact on the environment.
5.Environmental problems have a cultural and social context.
●Understanding the role of cultural, social and economic factors is vital to the
development of solutions.
6.Human survival depends on developing practices that will achieve sustainable systems.
●A suitable combination of conservation and development is required.
●Management of common resources is essential.
This course is intended to be the equivalent of a one-semester college environmental science course,
which is taught over an entire year in high school.  It is expected that the APES student will have
strong academic skills, focused on self-discipline, purposeful ambition, driving intellectual curiosity,
willingness to learn independently and a creative mind. Students need to approach this AP course with
the understanding that greater dedication and effort is required for success. Attendance, physical
and mental, is a must. An extra grade point is assigned for AP courses and must be earned. Students
should find this class compelling and exciting, but they should not underestimate its difficulty or the
fact that it will make significant demands on their time.
Course Prerequisites:
Students taking APES must have completed Biology and Chemistry with a minimum grade of a “B” in
Students taking APES must have completed Biology and Chemistry with a minimum grade of a “B” ineach class.
Course Textbook:
The Princeton Review: AP Environmental Science Exam 2013 (or most recent edition available)
Botkin, Keller, Environmental Science, Wiley, 6th edition (2007)
Course Planner/Outline:
Below is a list of the APES units we will be studying this year which includes a basic outline of unit
topics as well as the percentage of questions from each unit on the APES exam.  Multiple choice exams
will be given at the conclusion of each unit of study.  Students will also be required to complete a
series of essential skill questions and free response questions for each unit where they must
demonstrate thorough understanding of the material.  There will also be 1st and 2nd semester
comprehensive final exams.  Details for each unit, including daily activities/assignments, homework,
quizzes, and exams will be displayed on the course calendar located on the course website.  This
course is structured and designed with the intent of enabling students to be successful on the APES
exam, which is usually administered during the first few weeks of May.  Students are not required to
take the College Board AP Environmental Science Exam.  However, there are a number of number of
compelling reasons to do so and will be addressed by your instructor at the beginning of the school

/g131 Use a model based on ev idence to illustrate  the relationships 
between sy stems or between components of a sy stem. (HS-
LS1-4),(HS-LS1-5),(HS-LS1-7) 
Planning and Carrying Out Investigations  
Planning and carry ing out in 9 -12 builds on K-8 experiences and 
progresses to include inv estigations that prov ide ev idence for and 
test conceptual, mathematical, phy sical, and empirical models.  
/g131 Plan and conduct an inv estigation indiv idually  and 
collaborativ ely  to produce data to serv e as the basis for  
ev idence, and in the design: decide on ty pes, how much, and 
accuracy  of data needed to produce reliable measurements 
and consider limitations on the precision of the data (e.g., 
number of trials, cost, risk, time), and refine the design 
accordingly . (HS-LS1-3) 
Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions  
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9 –12 builds 
on K –8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs 
that are supported by  multiple and independent student -
generated sources of ev idence consistent with scientific ideas, 
principles,  and theories. 
/g131 C onstruct an explanation based on v alid and reliable ev idence 
obtained from a v ariety  of sources (including students’ own 
inv estigations, models, theories, simulations, peer rev iew) 
and the assumption that theories and laws that describe the  
natural world operate today  as they  did in the past and will 
continue to do so in the future. (HS-LS1-1)   
/g131 C onstruct and rev ise an explanation based on v alid and 
reliable ev idence obtained from a v ariety  of sources (including 
students’ own inv estigations,  models, theories, simulations, 
peer rev iew) and the assumption that theories and laws that 
describe the natural world operate today  as they  did in the 
past and will continue to do so in the future. (HS -LS1-6)   
Disciplinary Core Ideas 
LS1.A :  Structure and Function  
/g131 Sy stems of specialized cells within organisms help them 
perform the essential functions of life. (HS-LS1-1) 
/g131 A ll cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA  
molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA  that contain the 
instructions that code for the formation of proteins, which 
carry  out most of the work of cells. (HS-LS1-1) (Note: 
This Disciplinary  C ore Idea is also addressed by  HS-LS3 -
1.)  
/g131 Multicellular organisms hav e a hierarchical structural 
organization, in which any  one sy stem is made up of 
numerous parts and is itself a component of the next 
lev el. (HS-LS1-2) 
/g131 Feedback mechanisms maintai n a liv ing sy stem’s internal 
conditions within certain limits and mediate behav iors, 
allowing it to remain aliv e and functional ev en as external 
conditions change within some range. Feedback 
mechanisms can encourage (through positiv e feedback) 
or discourage (negativ e feedback) what is going on 
inside the liv ing sy stem. (HS-LS1-3) 
LS1.B:  Growth and Development of Organisms  
/g131 In multicellular organisms indiv idual cells grow and then 
div ide v ia a process called mitosis, thereby  allowing the 
organism to grow. The organism begins as a single cell 
(fertilized egg) that div ides successiv ely  to produce many  
cells, with each parent cell passing identical genetic 
material (two v ariants of each chromosome pair) to both 
daughter cells. C ellular div ision and differentiation 
produce and maintain a complex organism, composed of 
sy stems of tissues and organs that work together to meet 
the needs of the whole organism. (HS-LS1-4) 
LS1.C:  Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in 
Organisms  
/g131 The process of photosy nthesis conv erts light energy  to 
stored chemical energy  by  conv erting carbon dioxide plus 
water into sugars plus released oxy gen. (HS-LS1-5) 
/g131 The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, 
hy drogen, and oxy gen: their hy drocarbon backb ones are 
used to make amino acids and other carbon-based 
molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules 
(such as proteins or DNA ), used for example to form new 
cells. (HS-LS1-6) 
/g131 A s matter and energy  flow through different  
Crosscutting Concepts 
System s and System Models 
/g131 Models (e.g., phy sical, mathematical, 
computer models) can be used to 
simulate sy stems and interactions —
including energy , matter, and 
information flows —within and between 
sy stems at different scales. (HS-LS1-2) , 
(HS-LS1-4) 
Energy and Matter  
/g131 C hanges of energy  and matter in a 
sy stem can be described in terms of 
energy  and matter flows into, out of, 
and within that sy stem. (HS-LS1-5), 
(HS-LS1-6) 
/g131 Energy  cannot be created or 
destroy ed —it only  mov es between one 
place and another place, between 
objects and/or fields, or between 
sy stems. (HS-LS1-7) 
Structure and Function   
/g131 Inv estigating or designing new sy stems 
or structures requires a detailed 
examination of the properties of 
different materials, the structures of 
different components, and connections 
of components to rev eal its function 
and/or solv e a problem. (HS-LS1-1) 
Stability and Change  
/g131 Feedback (negativ e or positiv e) can 
stabilize or destabilize a sy stem. (HS-

Connections to Nature of Science  
Scientific Investigations Use a Variety of Methods  
/g131 Scientific inquiry  is characterized by  a common set of v alues 
that include: logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, 
obje ctiv ity , skepticism, replicability  of results, and honest and 
ethical reporting of findings. (HS-LS1-3) 
 organizational lev els of li v ing sy stems, chemical elements 
are recombined in different way s to form different 
products. (HS-LS1-6),(HS-LS1-7) 
/g131 A s a result of these chemical reactions, energy  is 
transferred from one sy stem of interacting molecules to 
another and release energy  to the surrounding 
env ironment and to maintain body  temperature. C ellular 
respiration is a chemical process whereby  the bonds of 
food molecules and oxy gen molecules are broken and 
new compounds are formed that can transport energy  to 
mu scles.  (HS -LS1 -7)

Constructing Explanations and Designing 
Solutions  
C onstructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–
12 builds on K –8 experiences and progresses to 
explanations and designs that are supported by  multiple 
and independent student- generated sources of ev idence 
consistent with scientific  ideas, principles, and theories.  
/g131 C onstruct and rev ise an explanation based on v alid 
and reliable ev idence obtained from a v ariety  of 
sources ( including students’ own inv estigation s, 
models, theories, simulations, peer rev iew) and the 
assumption that theories and laws that describe the 
natural world  operate today  as they  did in the past  
LS2.A :  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems  
/g131 Ecosy stems hav e carry ing capacities, which are limits to the numbers 
of organisms and populations they  can support. These limits result 
from such factors as the av ailability  of liv ing and nonliv ing resources 
and from such challenges such as predation, competition, and 
disease. O rganisms would hav e the capacity  to produce populations 
of great size were it not for the fact that env ironments and resources 
are finite. This fundamental tension a ffects the abundance (number 
of indiv iduals) of species in any  giv en ecosy stem. (HS-LS2-1),(HS -
LS2-2) 
LS2.B:  Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems   
/g131 Photosy nthesis and cellular respiration (including anaerobic 
processes) prov ide most of the energy  for life processes. (HS-LS 2-3) 
/g131 Plants or algae form the lowest lev el of the food web. A t eac h link 
upward in a food web, only  a small fraction of the matter consumed 
at the lower lev el is transferred upward, to produce growth and 
release energy  in cellular respiration at the higher lev el. Giv en this 
inefficiency , ther e are generally  fewer organisms at higher lev els of a 
food web. Some matter reacts to release energy  for life functi ons, 
some matter is stored in newly  made structures, and much is 
discarded. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of 
organisms pass through food webs and into and out of the 
atmosphere and soil, and they  are combined and recombined in 
different way s. A t each link in an ecosy stem, matter and energy  are 
conserv ed. (HS-LS2-4) 
/g131 Photosy nthesis and cellular respiration are important components of 
the carbon cy cle, in which carbon is exchanged among the 
biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and geosphere through chemical, 
phy sical, geological, and biological processes. (HS-LS2-5) 
LS2.C:  E cosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience 
/g131 A  complex set of interactions within an ecosy stem can keep its 
numbers and ty pes of organisms relativ ely  constant ov er long 
periods of time under stable conditions. If a modest biological or 
phy sical disturbance to an ecosy stem occurs, it may  return to its 
more or less original status (i.e., the ecosy stem is resilient), as 
opposed to becoming a v ery  different ecosy stem. Extreme 
fluctuations in conditions or the size of any  population, howev er, can 
challenge the functioning of ecosy stems in terms of resources and 
habitat av ailability . (HS -LS2 -2),(HS -LS2 -6)  
Cause and Effect 
/g131 Empirical ev idence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about 
specific causes and effects. (HS-LS2-8) 
Scale, Proportion, and Quantity  
/g131 The significance of a phenomenon is 
dependent on the scale, proportion, and 
quantity  at which it occurs. (HS-LS2-1) 
/g131 Using the concept of orders of magnitude 
allows one to understand how a model at 
one scale relates to a model at another 
scale. (HS-LS2-2) 
Systems and System Models  
including energy , matter, and information 
flows —within and between sy stems at 
different scales. (HS-LS2-5) 
/g131 Energy  cannot be created or destroy ed —
it only  mov es between one place and 
another place, between objects and/or 
fields, or between sy stems. (HS-LS2-4) 
/g131 Energy  driv es the cy cling of matter within 
and between sy stems. (HS-LS2-3)

explanations of how things change and 
how they  remain stable. (HS-LS2-6),(HS -

student-generated sources of ev idence, prioritized 
criteria, and tradeoff considerations. (HS-LS2-7) 
Engaging in A rgument from Evidence  
Engaging in argument from ev idence in 9–12 builds on 
K–8 experiences and progresses to using appropriate and 
sufficient ev idence and scientific reasoning to defend and

Scientific Knowledge is Open to Revision in Light 
of New E vidence 
/g131 Most scientific knowledge is quite durable, but is, in 
principle, subject to change based on new ev idence 
and/or reinterpretation of existing ev idence. (HS-
LS2-2),(HS-LS2-3) 
/g131 Scientific argumentation is a mode of logical 
discourse used to clarify  the strength of relationships 
between ideas and ev idence that may  result in

inv asiv e species, ov erexploitation, and climate change —can disrupt 
an ecosy stem and threaten the surv iv al of some species. (HS-LS2-7 )

/g131 Biodiv ersity  is increased by  the formation of new species (speciation)  
and decreased by  the loss of species (extinction). (secondary  to HS-
LS2-7)  
/g131 Humans depend on the liv ing world for the resources and other 
benefits prov ided by  biodiv ersity . But human activ ity  is also hav ing 
adv erse impacts on biodiv ersity  through ov erpopulation, 
ov erexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of 
inv asiv e species, and climate change. Thus sustaining biodiv ersity  so 
that ecosy stem functioning and productiv ity  are maintained is 
essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth. Sustaining 
biodiv ersity  also aids humanity  by  preserv ing landscapes of 
recreational or inspirational v alue. (secondary  to HS-LS2-7)  (Note:

molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA  that contain 
the instructions that code for the formation of 
proteins. (secondary  to HS-LS3-1) (Note: This 
Disciplinary  C ore Idea is also addressed by  HS-LS1- 1.) 
LS3.A :  Inheritance of T raits  
/g131 Each chromosome consists of a single v ery  long DNA  
molecule, and each gene on the chromosome is a 
particular segment of that DNA . The instructions for 
forming species’ characteristics are carried in DNA . A ll 
cells in an organism hav e the same genetic content, 
but the genes used (expressed) by  the cell may  be 
regulated in different way s. Not all DNA  codes for a 
protein; some segments of DNA  are inv olv ed in 
regulatory  or structural functions, and some hav e no 
as-y et known function. (HS-LS3-1) 
LS3.B:  Variation of T raits 
/g131 In sexual reproduction, chromosomes can sometimes 
swap sections during the process of meiosis (cell 
div ision), thereby  creating new genetic combinations 
and thus more genetic v ariation. A lthough  DNA  
replication  is  tightly  regulated  and  remarkably  accurate,  
errors  do occur  and  result  in  mutations,  which  are  also  
a source  of  genetic  v ariation.  Env ironmental factors can 
also cause mutations in genes, and v iable mutations 
are inherited. (HS-LS3-2) 
/g131 Env ironmental  factors  also  affect  expression  of  traits,  
and  hence  affect  the  probability  of occurrences of traits 
in a population. Thus the v ariation and distribution of 
traits observ ed depends on both genetic and 
env ironmental factors. ( HS -LS3 -2),(HS -LS3 -3)

causes and effects. (HS-LS3-1),(HS-LS3-2 )

HS-LS4-2. Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from  four factors:  (1) 
the potential for a specie s to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Informatio n  
O btaining, ev aluating, and communicating information in 9 –12  
LS4.A :  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity 
/g131 Genetic information prov ides ev idence of ev olution. DNA  
sequences v ary  among species, but there are many  ov erlaps ; 
in fact, the ongoing branching that produces multiple lines of 
descent can be inferred by  comparing the DNA  sequences of 
different organisms. Such information is also deriv able from the 
similarities and differences in amino acid sequences and from 
anatomical and embry ological ev idence. (HS-LS4-1) 
LS4.B:  Natural Selection 
/g131 Natural selection occurs only  if there is both (1) v ariation in th e 
genetic information betwe en organisms in a population and (2) 
v ariation in the expression of that genetic information —that is, 
trait v ariation —that leads to differences in perform ance among 
indiv iduals. (HS-LS4-2),(HS-LS4-3) 
/g131 The traits that positiv ely  affect surv iv al are more likely  to be 
reproduced, and thus are more common in the population. 
(HS-LS4-3) 
LS4.C:  A daptation 
/g131 Ev olution is a consequence of the interaction of four factors: 
(1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the 
genetic v ariation of indiv iduals in a species due to mutation and 
sexual reproduction, (3) competition for an env ironment’s 
limited supply  of the resources that indiv iduals need in order to 
surv iv e and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of 
those organisms that are better able to s urv iv e and reproduce 
in that env ironment. (HS-LS4-2) 
/g131 Natural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population 
dominated by  organisms that are anatomically , behav iorally , 
and phy siologically  well suited to surv iv e and reproduce in a 
specific env ironment. That is, the differential surv iv al and 
reproduction of organisms in a population that hav e an 
adv antageous heritable trait leads to an increase in the 
proportion of indiv iduals in future generations that hav e the 
trait and to a decrease in the proport ion of indiv iduals that do 
not. (HS-LS4-3),(HS-LS4-4) 
/g131 A daptation also means that the distribution of traits in a 
population can change when conditions change. (HS-LS4-3) 
/g131 C hanges in the phy sical env ironment, whether naturally  
occurring or human induced, hav e thus contributed to the 
expansion of some species, the emergence of new distinct 
species as populations div erge under different conditions, and 
the decline –and sometimes the extinction –of some species.

Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and T heories Expla in 
Natural Phenomena  
/g131 A  scientific theory  is a substantiated explanation of some 
aspect of the natural world, based on a body  of facts that 
hav e been repeatedly  confirmed through observ ation and 
experiment and the science community  v alidates each theory  
before it is accepted. If new ev idence is discov ered that the 
theory  does not accommodate, the theory  is generally  
modified in light of this new ev idence. (HS-LS4-1) /g131 Species become extinct because  they  can no longer surv iv e 
and reproduce in their altered env ironment. If members cannot 
adjust to change that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity  for 
the species’ ev olution is lost. ( HS-LS4-5)  
LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans  
benefits prov ided by  biodiv ersity . But human activ ity  is also 
hav ing adv erse impacts on biodiv ersity  through ov erpopulation, 
inv asiv e species, and climate change. Thus sustaining 
biodiv ersity  so that ecosy stem functioning and productiv ity  are 
maintained is essential to supporting and enhancing life on 
Earth. Sustaining biodiv ersity  also aids humanity  by  preserv ing 
landscapes of recreational or inspirational v alue. (HS-LS4-6)

The purpose of the Rocklin Basketball Club is to pr ovide an opportunity for boys that live in the Rocklin High School attendance 
area , to improve their basketball skills in a competiti ve and fun environment.  The RHS attendance area in cludes the following 
elementary schools:  Breen, Cobblestone, Parker Whi tney, Rocklin Elementary, Twin Oaks, and Valley Vie w.  If you attend Rocklin 
Academy but live in RHS attendance area, you can al so play in our program.  The RBC is an AAU program that is an extension of the 
RHS basketball program. We would like to have  ALL  of the boys that are interested in playing basketb all at RHS someday play in our 
program.  The RBC will teach: 1) offensive/defensiv e fundamentals, 2) offensive/defensive skill develo pment, 3) the RHS Offensive 
and Defensive systems, 4) how to work hard, have a positive attitude, and be a good teammate. 
We plan to have 8-10 or 16-20 players in each grade  level, depending on the number of kids that try-ou t and the skill level of the 
players in that age group.  This will allow us to e nter 1 or 2 teams in each tournament.  If there are  two teams in a grade level, they 
will be separated by ability and experience levels.   Practices for all 3 rd  – 6th  graders will begin the week of November 13 th .  Practices 
for 7 th  and 8 th  graders will begin the week of Dec 11th  after the middle school season ends.   
The winter season will run from November 13th – Feb ruary 18th.  All of our teams will practice 2 times  a week at RUSD elementary, 
middle schools, and RHS.  All of our teams will pla y in 5 tournaments at Hardwood Palace (Rocklin) or Courtside basketball Center 
(Rocklin).  Players are expected to attend practices and games in order to be on a team.    
RBC teams will be led by experienced coaches, under  the supervision of Steve Taylor, Varsity Boys Bask etball Coach at Rocklin HS.  
Coach Taylor brings 32 years of high school (Clovis  West, Fresno, Rocklin) and youth basketball coachi ng experience to the program.  
The RBC coaching staff will include: TBA (4 th ), Matt Grishman (5 th ), Randy Gustafson (6th), Jason Adams, Tim Baumert (7th ), Drew 
Ardissone, Ryan Brennan (8 th ).  Coach Taylor and the RHS Coaching Staff will he lp at all levels throughout the year.  We are looki ng 
for a Head Coach for the 4 th  grade team.   Assistant Coaches will be added befo re practices begin in November. 
The cost to participate in the RBC is estimated  to be $250-$275.  This fee includes a club fee ($4 0 per month for 3 months = $120), 
tourney fees (approximately $125 per player per sea son), district utility fee ($30).  If you have a un iform from a previous year, you 
DO NOT  have to purchase a new one.  If not, uniforms are $70.  T-shirts ($10) and sweatshirts ($20) are opti onal and can be 
purchased by players and parents. 
Players must attend one of the two try-out sessions .  However, it is recommended that the players atte nd both sessions, if 
possible.   Please arrive at try-outs 15 minutes early in ord er to fill out the registration form and get your s on checked in.  Players will 
be contacted by e-mail on Nov 13 th  to let them know if they made the team.  
      
Call Steve Taylor, RBC Director, at (916) 208-6266 or contact him at rocktownballers@gmail.com  if you have any questions about 
try-outs.  Also, log onto www.rocktownballers.com  to print off a registration form and for more info rmation about the RBC.

Academic Enrichment at Sierra College
Apply to Sierra College by clicking the “apply” button
on the
Sierra College home page
and set up your mySierra account when you receive
the email instructing you to do so
(usually within 24 hours of applying).
You can skip this step and set-up of your mySierra
account if you have taken a dual
enrollment course or other Sierra courses.
Browse the
“class schedule”
for courses that interest
you. MAke sure to click on the blue
CRN hyperlinks to read the course descriptions carefully
and make note of any pre or
corequisites. If you are trying to take classes that
will count toward your general
education once you get to college, take a look at
the
Sierra College IGETC
(UC/CSU
transfer requirements). Taking classes that follow
this pattern increases the likelihood
that you will earn meaningful college credit.
Visit
Sierra College’s “College in High School” page
and click on Academic Enrichment.
Follow the instructions for “Promise Schools,” making
sure you double check the
Academic Enrichment Restricted Course List
to make
sure you are eligible to take the
courses you enter on your Academic Enrichment form.
Once you have completed all steps on
Sierra College’s
“College in High School” page
you will be able to register for classes through your
mySierra account during your
registration window.
Remember that a semester long class at Sierra is similar
in scope to a year-long AP class in
high school and that during the summer sessions, that
same amount of work is squeezed into
the length of a half semester, so don’t overload yourself.
These courses and the grades you
earn will be placed on your permanent college transcript,
make sure you take them seriously.

rhs.rocklinusd.org_subsites_Career-Center_documents_What to do if you are waitlisted
What to Do 
If You’re Wait-Listed  
Being put on the wait-list by your first-choice sch ool can be worse than being rejected—it 
hangs you up. If a college tells you that’s where y ou are, try to decide whether you really want 
to attend that school before you agree to remain on  the list. 
But it doesn’t have to be a passive waiting game. H ere are some things you can do. 
Get a better sense of your chances of 
admission 
Colleges sometimes rank waiting lists. 
The higher you rank on the list the better 
your chances of being accepted. Contact 
the admission office to find out if it ranks 
wait-listed students or if it has a priority 
list. Most admission officers will tell you 
what you need to know. 
Write a letter to the admission office 
Being wait-listed means the school has 
already determined you have the 
academic credentials; so it’s the 
nonacademic factors that count most now. 
Tell them about any achievements or new 
information that didn’t make it onto your 
application. Emphasize your strong desire 
to attend the college and make a case for 
why you’re a good fit. You can also enlist 
the help of an alumnus and your high 
school counselor. 
Request another (or a first) interview 
An interview can give you a personal 
contact— someone who can check on the 
status of your application. 
Finish high school strong 
This is no time to slack off. If you’re wait-
listed, you may be reevaluated based on 
your third- and fourth-quarter grades. 
 Stay involved 
Show admission officers you’re committed 
to sports, clubs, and other activities. 
In the meantime, protect yourself 
Look, chances of being accepted off of a 
wait list are never very good, and you 
won’t find out if you’ve made it in or not 
until after the May 1 deadline to accept 
admission elsewhere has passed. So: 
Reconsider the colleges that have 
accepted you 
Your next-best choice isn’t a bad choice—
otherwise you wouldn’t have applied 
there. Send in that deposit and plan to 
attend. You’ll be surprised how much 
better you feel knowing that you have 
secured a place at a college that really 
wants you. 
If you do get in, make sure it’s still a 
good deal 
Pay close attention to the conditions 
attached to being wait-listed; you may 
lose priority housing or financial aid

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:  
SECTION 1. It is the intent of the Legislature that nothing in Section 48907 or 48950 of  the Education

  BP 1325  
Community Relations  
 Advertising And Promotion  
***Note: The following optional policy addresses the distribution of commercial and 
noncommercial materials by the district as well as advertising in school -sponsored 
publications and on school property. The personal distribution of materials by students is 
addressed in BP/AR 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression. ***  
***Note:  Boards should carefully consider whether they wish to establish a "closed 
forum" or a  "limited open foru m" regarding the distribution of materials at district 
schools.  In a "closed forum," advertising would not be accepted in school -sponsored 
publications and  materials from non -school -sponsored groups would not be distributed 
on school grounds.  For exampl e, the school could not distribute flyers from the local Girl 
Scout troop or Little League, nor could ads be accepted from businesses in the school 
yearbook. ***  
***Note:  A "limited open forum" is a type of nonpublic forum intentionally opened to 
certai n groups or certain topics. In a "limited open forum," school officials may impose 
reasonable restrictions on the distribution of materials or advertising and may selectively 
approve or disapprove materials or advertising as long as the decision is not arb itrary or 
capricious; restrictions must be viewpoint -neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose 
served by the forum (Lehman v. Shaker Heights, DiLoreto v. Downey Unified School 
District). In addition, districts may establish a "limited open forum" rela tive to student 
clubs, but a "closed forum" for advertising.  See BP/AR 6145.5 - Student Organizations 
and Equal Access for language related to student clubs and the federal Equal Access Act. 
***  
***Note:   Option 1 is for use by districts that have esta blished a "closed forum."  Option 
2 and the remainder of the policy are for use by districts that have established a "limited 
open forum." Districts may establish different forums for different schools within the 
district (e.g., an elementary school may ha ve a "closed forum"; a high school a "limited 
open forum") and the following policy should be modified accordingly.  It's important to 
note that, when determining whether a district has established a "closed forum" or 
"limited open forum," courts would loo k beyond the district's intent as stated in its policy 
and also look to the actual practice of school officials (Board of Education of the 
Westside Community Schools v. Mergens)  Therefore, this policy should be applied in a 
consistent manner at each schoo l.  Because this is a complex and evolving area of law, it 
is strongly recommended that legal counsel be consulted prior to the adoption of policy in 
this area. ***
this area. ***   
OPTION 1:  Closed Forum  
The Governing Board desires to limit student exposure to advertis ing and promotional 
materials.  Therefore, in order to maintain a closed forum on school campuses, 
advertising shall not be accepted in school -sponsored publications. In addition, flyers and 
promotional materials from non -school -sponsored groups shall not be distributed.   
***Note:  Districts that have created a "closed forum" must delete the remainder of this 
policy in order to ensure that their "closed forum" status is maintained. ***  
OPTION 2:  Limited Open Forum  
The Governing Board desires to promote  positive relationships between schools and the 
community in order to enhance community support and involvement in district schools. 
The Superintendent or designee may approve:  
***Note: The district may select any or all of optional items #1 -5 below to re flect the 
types of materials and/or advertising that it will allow. ***  
1. Distribution of noncommercial materials that publicize services, special events, 
public meetings or other items of interest to students or parents/guardians  
(cf. 1400 - Relations  Between Other Governmental Agencies and the Schools)  
(cf. 5145.2 - Freedom of Speech/Expression)  
(cf. 6145.5 - Student Organizations and Equal Access)  
(cf. 6162.8 - Research)  
2. Distribution of promotional materials of a commercial nature to students or 
parents/guardians  
(cf. 1700 - Relations Between Private Industry and the Schools)  
3. Paid advertisements on school property, including but not limited to billboard 
advertisements  
4. Paid advertisements in school -sponsored publications, yearbooks, annou ncements 
and other school communications  
(cf. 1113 - District and School Web Sites)  
5. Products and materials donated by commercial enterprises for use in the 
classroom, as long as they serve an educational purpose and do not unduly promote any

donor.
donor.  
 (cf. 3290 - Gifts, Grants and Bequests)  
(cf. 6161.11 - Supplementary Instructional Materials)  
Prior to distribution or publication, the Superintendent, principal or desig nee shall review 
and approve all advertising copy and promotional materials to ensure compliance with 
Board policy.  
***Note:  Generally, courts have upheld procedures that place reasonable "time, place 
and manner" restrictions on materials to be distribut ed, as long as the same restrictions 
were placed on all materials (Hemry v. School Board of Colorado Springs).  Districts 
might want to consider developing procedures that limit the "time, place and manner" of 
distributions, such as limiting distribution t o before or after school hours or creating a 
central location for the distribution of all materials.  Legal counsel should be consulted as 
appropriate. ***  
The Superintendent, principal or designee may selectively approve or disapprove 
distribution of ma terials or publishing of copy based on the criteria listed below, but may 
not disapprove materials or copy in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in a way that 
discriminates against a particular viewpoint on a subject that would otherwise be allowed.  
All materials to be distributed shall bear the name and contact information of the 
sponsoring entity.  
***Note:  Districts might also consider requiring sponsoring entities to include a 
disclaimer on all materials to be distributed.  For example, a disclaimer  might state that 
"this event is not school -sponsored or approved" or that "opinions are not necessarily 
those of the school district or school personnel."  Districts wishing to include disclaimer 
language should consult legal counsel as appropriate. ***  
The use of promotional materials or advertisements does not imply district endorsement 
of any identified products or services. Schools are encouraged to include a disclaimer in 
school publications and yearbooks stating that the school does not endorse any  advertised 
products or services.  
Criteria for Approval  
The Superintendent, principal or designee shall not accept for distribution any materials 
or advertisements that:  
1. Are obscene, libelous or slanderous (Education Code 48907)  
2. Incite students to commit unlawful acts, violate school rules or disrupt the orderly 
operation of the schools (Education Code 48907)  
***Note:  Optional item #3 below prohibits the distribution of political materials or 
political advertising except under certain circumsta nces. Pursuant to Education Code
political advertising except under certain circumsta nces. Pursuant to Education Code 7058, the Board may conduct a political forum if it is made available to all sides on an 
equitable basis. ***  
3. Promote any particular political interest, candidate, party or ballot measure, unless 
such materials are bein g distributed at a forum in which candidates or advocates from all 
sides are presenting their views to the students during school hours or during events 
scheduled pursuant to the Civic Center Act  
(cf. 1160 - Political Processes)  
(cf. 1330 - Use of School Facilities)  
(cf. 4119.25/4219.25/4319.25 - Political Activities of Employees)  
***Note:  The law is unclear as to whether districts can prohibit the distribution of 
materials or advertising of a religious nature when materials of a non -religious nature are  
also distributed during school.  Both the Ninth Circuit and Second District Court of 
Appeals, addressing different claims in DiLoreto v. Downey Unified School District, held 
that a California district's refusal to post a paid religious advertisement featu ring the Ten 
Commandments on an athletic field fence where commercial advertising was permitted 
did not violate the free speech rights of the proposed advertiser when it was clear that the 
district did not open the forum (the fence) to all expressive activ ity.  Both courts 
concluded that, regardless of whether or not the advertisement violated the Establishment 
Clause of the U.S. or California Constitutions, the district had the right to regulate 
content as a nonpublic forum. Districts wishing to establish policy dealing with the 
distribution of religious materials should consult legal counsel. ***  
4. Discriminate against, attack or denigrate any group on account of any unlawful 
consideration  
(cf. 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activiti es) 
5. Promote the use or sale of materials or services that are illegal or inconsistent with 
school objectives, including but not limited to materials or advertisements for tobacco, 
intoxicants, and movies or products unsuitable for children  
6. Solicit funds or services for an organization, with the exception of solicitations 
authorized in Board policy  
(cf. 1321 - Solicitation of Funds from and by Students)  
7. Distribute unsolicited merchandise for which an ensuing payment is requested  
The Superintend ent or designee also may consider the educational value of the materials 
or advertisements, the age or maturity of students in the intended audience, and whether 
the materials or advertisements support the basic educational mission of the district, 
directl y benefit the students or are of intrinsic value to the students or their 
parents/guardians.

(cf. 0000 - Vision)  
Schools may establish additional criteria pertaining to the content of advertisements in 
school publications and yearbooks. Such criteria ma y limit advertisements to those that 
contain congratulatory or commemorative messages, curriculum -related content, 
advertisements for products or services of interest to students, noncontroversial content, 
and/or other content deemed appropriate by the sch ool publication staff and adviser in 
accordance with law and Board policy.

 Publications I -IV- The Tonitrus Yearbook  
 Literary Magazine  Out of the Blue  
 Multi Media Storytelling “The Show”  
This docum ent is intended as an over -all staff policy for each of these programs. Where 
specific top ics are covered, they are noted and in some cases specific programs may have 
additional  policies.  
I. STATEMENT OF POLICY  
Freedom of expression and press freedom are fundamental values in a democratic 
society. The mission of  any institution committed to preparing productive citizens must 
include teaching students these values, both by  lesson and by example.  
As determined by the courts, student exercise of freedom of ex pression and press 
freedom is protected by  both state and federal law, especially by the First Amendment to 
the United States Constitution. Accordingly,  school officials are responsible for 
encouraging and ensuring freedom of expression and press freedom f or students.  
It is the policy of the Rocklin Unified Board of Education that The Flash newsmagazine 
and web production, Tonitrus yearbook , Out of the Blue literary magazine  and broadcast 
and web production staffs , the official, school -sponsored student me dia of  
Rocklin  High School have been established as forums for student expression and as 
voices  in the uninhibited, robust, free and open discussio n of issues (except as noted
voices  in the uninhibited, robust, free and open discussio n of issues (except as noted within). Each medium should provide a full opportunity  for students to inquire, question 
and exchange ideas. Content should reflect all areas of student interest, including  topics 
about which there may be dissent or controversy.   
It is the policy of the Rocklin Unified School District  Board of Education that student 
journalists shall  have  the right to determine the content of student media. Accordingly, 
the following guidelines relate only to establishing  grounds for disciplinary actions 
subsequent to publication.  
II. OFFICIAL STUDENT MEDIA  
A. Responsibilities of Student Journalists  
Students who work on official, school -sponsored student publications or electronic media 
determine the  content of their respective publications and are responsible for that content. 
These students should:  
l. Determine the content of the student media;  
2. Strive to produce media based upon professional standards of accuracy, objectivity and 
fairness;  
3. Review material to improve sentence structure, grammar, spelling and punctuation;  
4. Check and verify all facts and verify the accuracy of all quotations; a nd 
5. In the case of editorials or letters to the editor concerning controversial issues, 
determine the need for  rebuttal comments and opinions and provide space therefore if 
appropriate.  
B. Unprotected Expression  
The following types of student expression  will not be protected:  
1. Material t hat is "obscene as to minors." Obscene as to minors is defined as material 
that meets all  three of the following requirements:  
(a) The average person, applying contemporary community standards, w ould find that the 
publi cation, taken as a whole, appeals to a minor's prurient interest in sex; and  
(b) The publication depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct such 
as ultimate sexual  acts (normal or perverted), masturbation and lewd exhibition of the 
genitals; and;  
(c) The work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
Indecent or vulgar  language is not obscene.  
2. Libelous material. Libelous statements are provably false and unprivileged statements 
of fact tha t do demonstrated injury to an individual's or business's reputation in the 
community. If the allegedly libeled party  is a "public figure" or "public official" as 
defined below, then school officials must show that the false statement  was published 
"with a ctual malice," i.e., that the student journalists knew that the statement was false or  
that they published it with reckless disregard for the truth  without trying to verify the 
truthfulness of the statement.  
(a) A public official is a person who holds an elected or appointed public off ice and 
exercises a significant amount of governmental authority.  
(b) A public figure is a person who either has sought the public's attention or is well 
known because of  personal achievements or actions.
known because of  personal achievements or actions.  (c) School employees  will be considered public officials or public figures in rela tionship 
to articles concerning their school -related activities.  
(d) When an allegedly libelous statement concerns an individual who is not a public 
official or a public  figure, school officials  must show that the false statement was 
published willfully or negligently, i.e., the student  journalist who wrote or published the 
statement has failed to exercise reasonably prudent care.  
(e) Students are free to express opinions.  Specifically, a student  may criticize s chool 
policy or the performance of teachers, administrators, school officials and other school 
employees.  
3. Material that will cause "a material and substantial disruption of school activities."  
(a) Disruption is defined as student rioting , unlawful seizures of property, destruct ion of 
property, or substantial student participation in a school boycott, sit -in, walkout or other 
related form of activity. Material such  as racial, religious or ethnic slurs, however 
distasteful, is not in and of  itself disruptive under these guidelines.  Threats of violence are 
not materially disruptive without some act in furtherance of that threat or a reasonable  
belief and expectation that the author of the threat has the capability and intent of 
carrying throu gh on that  threat in a manner that does not allow acts other than 
suppression of speech to mitigate the threat in a timely  manner. Material that stimulates 
heated discussion or debate does not constitute the type of disruption prohibited.  
(b) For student m edia to be considered disruptive, specific facts must exist upon which 
one could reasonably forecast that a likelihood of immediate, substantial material 
disruption to normal school activity would  occur if the material were further distributed 
or has occur red as a result of the material's distribution or dissemination.  
Mere undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough; school 
administrators must  be able affirmatively to show substantial facts that reasonably 
support a forecast of likel y disruption.  
(c) In determining whether student media is disruptive, consideration must  be given to the 
context of the distribution as well as the content of the material. In this regard, 
consideration should be given to past experience  
in the school with  similar material, past experience in the school in d ealing with and 
supervising the students in the school, current events influencing student attitudes and 
behavior and whether there have been  any instances of actual or threatened disruption 
prior to or contemporaneously with the dissemination of the  student publication in 
question.  
(d) School officials must protect advocates of unpopular viewpoints.  
(e) "School activity" means educational student activity sponsored by the  school and 
includes, by way of example and not by way of limitation, classroom work, official 
assemblies and other similar gatherings, school  athletic contests, band concerts, school 
plays and scheduled in -school lunch periods.  
C. Legal Advice  
1. If, in the opinion of a student editor, student editorial staff or faculty  adviser, material 
proposed for publication may be "obscene," "libelous" or would cause an "immediate, 
material and substantial disruption  of school activities," the legal opinion of a practicing 
attorney should be sought.  The services of the attorney  for the local newspaper or the free 
legal services of the Student Press Law Center (703/807 -1904) are recommended.
legal services of the Student Press Law Center (703/807 -1904) are recommended.  2. Any legal fees charged in connection with the consultation will be paid by the board of 
3. The fi nal decision of whether the material is to be published will be left t o the student 
editor or student editorial staff.  
D. Protected Speech  
1. School officials cannot:  
a. Ban student expression solely because it is controversial, takes extreme,  "fringe" or  
minority opinions, or is distasteful, unpopular or unpleasant;  
b. Ban the publication or distribution of material relating to sexual issues including, but 
not limited to,  virginity, birth control and sexually -transmitted diseases (including AIDS);  
c. Cens or or punish the occasional use of indecent, vulgar or so called "four -letter" words 
in student publications;  
d. Prohibit criticism of the policies, practices or performance of teachers, school officials, 
the school itself  or of any public officials;  
e. Cu t off funds to official student media because of disagreement over editorial policy;  
f. Ban student expression that merely advocates illegal conduct without provi ng that such 
speech is directed toward and will actually cause imminent unlawful action.  
g. Ba n the publication or distribution by students of material written by nonstudents;  
h. Prohibit the endorsement of candidates for student office or for public office at any 
level.  
2. Commercial Speech  
Advertising is constitutionally protected expression. Stu dent media may  accept 
advertising. Acceptance or rejection of advertising is within the purview of the 
publication staff, which may accept any ads except  those for products or services that are 
illegal for all students. Ads for political candidates and bal lot issues may  be accepted; 
however publication staffs are encouraged to solicit ads from all sides on such issues.  
E. On -Line Student Media and Use of Electronic Information Resources  
1. On -Line Student Media.  
Online media, including Internet Web sites, social media sites , and blogs may be used by 
students like any other communications media to reach both those within the school and  
those beyond it. All official, school -sponsored online student publications are entitled to 
the same protections  and are sub ject to no greater limitations than other student media, as 
described in this policy  except as noted below.  
2. Electronic Information Resources  
Student journalists may use electronic information resources, including Interne t Web 
sites, e -mail, listserves and social media , to gather news and information, to communicate 
with other students  and individuals and to ask questions of and consult with sources. 
School officials will apply the same criteria  used in determining the suitability of other 
educational and  information resources to attempts to remove or  restrict student media 
access to online and electronic material. Just as the purchase, availability and use of  
media materials in a classroom or library does not indicate endorsement of their contents 
by scho ol officials,  neither does making electronic information available to students 
imply endorsement of that content.
imply endorsement of that content.  Although faculty advisers to student media are encouraged to help students develop the 
intellectual skills needed to evaluate and appropriatel y use electronically available 
information to meet their news gathering  purposes, advisers are not responsible for 
approving the online resources used or created by their students.  
3. Acceptable Use Policies  
The Board recognizes that the technical and net working environment nec essary for online 
communication may require that school officials define guidelines for student exploration 
and use of electronic information  resources. The purpose of such guidelines will be to 
provide for the orderly, efficient and  fair operation of  the school's online resources. The 
guidelines may not be used to unreasonably restrict student use of or communication  
through  the online media.  
Such guidelines may address the following issues: file size limits, passwo rd management, 
system security, data downloading protocol, use of domain names, use of copyrighted 
software, access to computer facilities,  computer hacking, computer etiquette and data 
privacy.  
III. ADVISER JOB SECURITY  
The student media adviser is not a censor. No person  who advises a student publication 
will be fired,  transferred  or removed from the adviser role  by reason of his or her refusal 
to exercise editorial control over  student media or to otherwise suppress the protected 
free expression of student journalists.  SB 1370  
V. PRIOR  REVIEW/ RESTRAINT  
No student media, whether non -school -sponsored or official, will be re viewed by school 
administrators prior to distribution or withheld from distribution. The school assumes no 
liability for the content of any student  publication, and urges all student journalists to 
recognize that with editorial control comes responsibility, including  the responsibility to 
follow professional journalism standards each school year.  EC 48970  
. 
Rocklin High School Content  Statement for Pu blications  
By virtue of the fact that the productions are student conceived, planned and produced  as 
well as products of academic programs, there are certain guidelines that must be put into 
practice ethically and legally.  
Journalistic in nature, the pro ductions attempt to inform , educate , and entertain  their 
audiences in a broad, fair , and accurate manner on all subjects tha t affect readers. In 
addition, T he Flash news magazine  staff through its print editions and online work  seeks 
to provide a public forum for the opinions of students, the staff of the paper, and the 
faculty to encourage  an exchange of ideas and opinions on issues of prominence to 
readers.
readers.  
 The entire student body of prospective readers constitutes the primary target audience  of 
the prod uctions with secondary audiences of parents, school personnel, community 
members and other scholastic journalism groups. Content focuses on coverage that will 
meet the wants and needs of the majority of these students.  
While the staff not only allows, but  also encourages, constructive criticism of any part of 
the production, before or after distribution, final authority for the content rest s solely in 
the hands of student journalists through each production staff’s  editorial board  unless 
otherwise noted in  this document  (EC 48907). No material, opinionated or otherwise, will 
be printed which is libelous, irresponsible, advocates an illegal activity or which the 
editorial board deems in poor taste.  
Editorial Leadership  
The Editorial Board for each productio n is the decision -making body. Members will be 
selected at the beginning of each semester by the adviser and staff and will consist of an 
odd number of voting members. The production adviser will serve in that same role, but 
will not vote.  
The board cont rols its own membership and may remove a member for failure to attend 
meetings or meet other expectations through a majority vote. If the adviser appeals  that 
vote, the board may confirm the decision with a unanimous vote. By the same method, 
the board may  remove staff members who are not meeting job expectations.  The 
teacher/adviser will work with the student to continue academic work until such time as 
their schedule can be changed. The teacher/adviser may request a schedule change for 
disciplinary reason s. 
All board members will vote on decisions such as policy -making or controversial content 
when the need arises. A majority vote determines the decision. The adviser will not vote, 
but may advise  and make suggestions or comments. The adviser may suspend  decision s 
of questions based on legality or irresponsible  business practices . The adviser, or any 
board member, has the right to appeal to the Publications Board.  
The Publications Board will be made up of two representatives appointed by the 
Associated Stu dent Body President;  only one may be a member of the leadership class, as 
well as two certificated  staff member s and a classified member agreed upon by the 
advisers and one member of administration appointed by the Principal. They will meet 
only upon reque st, and a majority vote will determine all final decisions.  
Any appeal beyond this level must go to the Superintende nt of Schools for consideration 
by the Board of Trustees. These appeals are limited to questions of legality, business 
management, or staff  membership.  
Rocklin HS programs are a limited open forum as defined by AR 1325 and BP 1325. At 
all times, the editorial board will work within the guidelines of the California  State 
Education Code 48907  and Rocklin Unified School District Board Policy 6145.3. (see 
appendix)
appendix)   
Correction Policy  
If a staff discovers, from any source, that a mistake was published and passed the editors, 
a correction of major errors will be made up on request in the most expedient and 
appropriate way possible as determined by t he Editorial Board.  Each staff will create its 
own policy on corrections.  
Advertising Policy  
To help finance the productions, the staffs may sell advertising at rates published 
annually. Students who appear in advertisements (other than Senior Ads) must s ign a 
model release. The Editorial Board (s) reserve s the right to determine the appropriateness 
of advertising and refuse sal e and publication without cause. However, each staff will 
determine its own  appropriate advertising policy. No advertising will be  published for 
activities illegal to the youngest member of the student population.  
The district and department recognize that as self -sustaining bu sinesses, the news 
magazine , magazine and yearbook can not be restricted in their efforts to only businesse s 
that do not compete with other fund raisers, curriculum, or school related or preferred 
businesses without a due process. The real -world financial management of these 
productions is seen as a critical element in the learning process.  
Due process appeals will be submitted to the adviser and principal and reviewed within 
30 days by the editorial board of the specific publication.  
Obituary Policy  
Should a student or faculty member die at any time during the current coverage period, 
the staff will treat the  death in a tasteful, respectful manner.  
In the news magazine , a short obituary, with the individual’s name, school activities, date 
of birth, date and manner of death (if appropriate), and any other pertinent information, 
will appear in the news section . A mug shot may be used. The appropriate  treatment will 
provide adequate memory of the individual for those closely associated, while not 
overemphasizing it for other readers.  Any accompanying circumstances may be covered 
as a new event. Often death will be  handled on the newspaper’s web  site as outlined 
above.  
In the yearbook, the portrait of that person will appear as it would under normal 
circumstances . If deadlines allow, the death may be covered as a new event if deemed 
appropriate by the editorial bo ard. If deadline allows the person’s name in the index will 
appear in bold with years of birth and death.
appear in bold with years of birth and death.

Portrait Policy  
All students and school personnel must have their portrait made with the official school 
portrait ph otographer in order to be included in the current volume of the publication.  
Seniors may choose to pay a minimal fee for a full portrait sitting to cover the costs of 
proofs.  
By having all portraits taken by the same photographer under the same conditions , the 
publications staff can be assured of the highest quality reproduction of all photographs, 
serving the best interests of all students and staff.  
All underclass photographs must be taken in a timely manner according to a schedule to 
be determined by t he yearbook editorial board or adviser. All photos will be taken by the

value.  
Exchanges can be made for books with minor flaws if no writing has been done in the 
book. If a book has been written in, then no exchange can be made unless the advis er 
feels the flaw in the book is  of major proportion ( i.e. pages missing, pages in upside 
down).  It will be the responsibility of the buyer to provide proof of purchase if the staff 
can provide no record. A valid receipt or a cancelled check deposited  in the publications 
account will constitute proof of purchase.  
Any purchased book not claimed by Labor Day Weekend  of the following year becomes 
the property of the yearbook staff and may be refunded with a written request.  
The staff and editorial board will determine the cost of an individual copy based on a 
balanced budget.

the editorial board. The staff will publish a payment and materials schedule by Sept. 1 of 
each year and reserve  the right to refuse publication to any parent or advertise w ho does
