Head Coach - Dale Eckenburg
After 20+ years of guiding the RHS Tennis program; I still can't believe I get the chance to work with a wonderful group of young people. We have worked hard to develop a program that incorporates academics, tennis, fun and a sense of family.
Our student athletes have developed a team that strives to include every athlete in numerous activities that support the whole tennis player.  As a player at Nevada Union High School I learned from Mr. Houlihan the value of the team and the importance of creating opportunities for the players who play the USTA circuit to the recreational player who wants local opportunities to learn their craft.

Assistant Coach - Kelly Follett
After raising four kids, who are now out of the house, I knew I wanted to get back into helping young students learn and grow their tennis skills. I knew the impact my tennis coaches had on me as a teen and I am excited to be doing the same. This is my 4th year coaching at Rocklin High School coaching high school tennis. I play tennis 3-5 days a week socially and on different competitive USTA teams..When I’m not on the court, you’ll find me visiting my kids, volunteering locally and hiking or skiing in the mountains! I am ready to help the students find and develop their tennis skills.
