Thank you for volunteering to be a Choral Student Director!  This is a wonderful way to develop your skills as a musician, an educator and a leader.  There will be many challenges along the way, but the rewards are unlike any other.  Here we go!
 
Assignments
Fall Semester - Students Conductors may...

Teach a lesson on vocal technique (20-30min)
Direct warm-ups once a week (10-15min)
Teach at least one basic concept of Music Theory during the course of the semester
Teach and direct 1-2 for the Winter Concert.  You can look in our music library or online at either of these sites:  www.jwpepper.com , www.sbmp.com , www.cpdl.org , www.cipoo.n

Spring Semester - Student Conductors may...

Direct warm-ups twice a week (10-15min)
Teach at least two basic concepts of Music Theory during the course of the semester
Teach and direct 1-2 pieces for the Spring Concert.  At least one of these pieces must include either mixed meter (ex. 3/4 and 4/4) or irregular meter (ex. 5/4, 7/4).

Lessons
Within the first few weeks of each semester we will be meeting after school to schedule your lessons and to go over how to create and organize lesson plans.  Lesson plans will be due the class before you teach.  We will discuss effective teaching methods, conducting patterns, etc.  If you have any questions regarding what you are teaching or how to teach it, please do not hesitate to ask.
 
Participation
If you are not teaching directly during class, you should be singing with your group.  If you are not a member of the choir you direct, you will be serving as a kind of "super section leader."  I might have you take a section into another room to go over parts or sing with a certain section to help reinforce good sound and intonation.  This means you should be familiar with all ensemble repertoire, not just the songs you are teaching.
 
Good luck and don't ever hesitate to ask for help or come to me with any problems.  It is my goal to be as supportive as possible in order to make this experience a successful one for you and your students.
