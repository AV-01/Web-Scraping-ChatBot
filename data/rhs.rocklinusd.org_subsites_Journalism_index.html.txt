JOURNALISM
Rocklin High School offers a full scope and sequence in journalism leading to production in all modern areas. In addition, the Communication Studies program continues to work toward full convergence of all media programs giving students opportunities to produce and publish media in a variety of formats. These include a traditional feature magazine, literary magazine and yearbook. In addition journalism is actively involved in the school's internal news feature broadcast , social media in a variety of formats, and online publication. Our photojournalism courses support production in all areas. We also offer Communication Studies 71 as a Dual Enrollment course with Sierra College and expect to expand that in the future.
