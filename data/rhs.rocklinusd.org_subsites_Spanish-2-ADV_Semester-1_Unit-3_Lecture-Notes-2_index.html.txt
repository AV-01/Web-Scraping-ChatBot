REFLEXIVE VERBS
What is a reflexive verb?
For our Spanish 2 ADV working definition, we will consider a verb to be reflexive if the person doing the action is also receiving the action.
For example: I brush my teeth.
Who is doing the brushing?
Who is being brushed?
How do you conjugate a reflexive verb?
The first step is to cover the "se"—that is the part of the infinitive that lets you know the verb is reflexive. Then, conjugate the verb to match the person performing the action and to the appropriate tense (present, present progressive, future OR any other tense for that matter-a verb that is reflexive will be reflexive in ALL tenses). You conjugate it the same way as any other –AR, -ER, or –IR ending verb
for that tense
.
The second step is to add a reflexive pronoun to each CONJUGATION.
REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS
ME
(myself)
NOS
(ourselves)
TE
(yourself)
XXXXX
SE
(himself/herself/yourself)
SE
(themselves/yourselves)
Where do you place the reflexive pronoun in relation to the verb?
Although you can place the reflexive pronoun in 3 different places ( as shown below)
It is EASIER to place it before the conjugated verb or verbal phrase
.
Before a conjugated verb OR
verbal phrase
---
Me
cepillo los dientes.
OR --- cepillo los dientes.
After and attached to an infinitive---Tengo que cepillar
me
los dientes.
After and attached to a gerund--- Estoy cepillándo
me
los dientes.
OR --- cepillo los dientes.
What do reflexive verbs look like?
You’ve already been doing this to the verb "llamarse". Check it out in the present tense:
I call myself
We call ourselves
You call yourself
He calls himself/
She calls herself
You (formal) call yourself
They call themselves Y’all call yourselves
Me llamo
Nos llamamos
Te llamas
Se llama
Se llaman
