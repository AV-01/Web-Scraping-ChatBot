STATISTICS 
2013-2014 
Prep: Period 8 for extra help
email: emitchell@rocklin.k12.ca.us






STATISTICS: this full year course is designed to introduce the students to statistics and prepare them to pass a required statistics class at the college level. The topics for Statistics are divided into four major themes: exploratory analysis, planning a study, probability, and statistical inference.  We will be using Stats: Modeling the World (Bock, Velleman, DeVeaux) for our text as well as many other resources.  The essential skills that will be covered in this course are:


Data Displays  Probability
Measures of Center and Spread Random Variables
Standard Normal Calculations  Binomial and Geometric Distributions
Least-Squares Regression  Sampling Distributions 
Contingency Tables  Confidence Intervals
Designing Experiments  Significance Tests (z, t)






SUPPLIES:
1. Graphing Calculator: You will need the TI 83 Graphing calculator (or the TI 83 Plus or TI 84) for this class.  Please acquire by September 16.
2. Loose-leaf notebook and graph paper: Loose-leaf is required for collected assignments. Assignments can be typed.
3. Blue or black pens, pencils, a ruler. No assignments, tests, or quizzes will be accepted if written in any other color ink then blue or black. (Pencil is best.)


GRADING SYSTEM:
o Essential Skills (35%)
o Tests (35%)  
o Projects and Quizzes(15%)
o Assignments(15%)  


All students will receive a grade or an NC (no credit) at the end of each semester.  In addition to earning a minimum percentage of overall work (70%), students need to show mastery on all essential concepts (State Standards). Failure to show mastery on all concepts will result in a final grade of NC. Students will have multiple opportunities to achieve mastery throughout each semester.


EXTRA HELP:
Extra help is available before school any day after 7:10, after school until 3:00 pm, and other times by appointment.  Additional time may be scheduled during the year as determined by need.


WEBSITES: 
Students and parents can check the course calendar, assignments and handouts using the teacher links from the RHS website or the following: www.edline.net or schoology.rocklinusd.org.


Parent/ Teacher Communication can be made through email or telephone conversation.  Email is the preferred method and response time is quicker than through a voicemail message.  Parents will be informed of serious discipline or academic problems.
