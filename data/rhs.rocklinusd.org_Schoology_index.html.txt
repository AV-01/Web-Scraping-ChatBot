Schoology






 Visually familiar to users of Facebook and other popular social networking websites,
 the service includes attendance records, online grade book, tests and quizzes, and homework
drop boxes. The social media interface facilitates collaboration among a class, a group, or
a school. Schoology can be integrated with existing school reporting and information 
systems and also provides the added security, filters and support that school districts may
require. Schoology also allows you to communicate with your teachers and ask a variety of
questions. Students can also create and join clubs based on their interests.
