RHS Choir Trip-We are waiting word from RUSD about a future choir trip. We understand these trips and festivals are a vital part of the growth process for music students. Trips and festivals promote excellence in musicianship as well as build vital relational community for our students. We hope the return of trips and festivals will be soon.
