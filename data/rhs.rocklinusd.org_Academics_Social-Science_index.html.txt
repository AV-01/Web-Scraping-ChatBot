The Social Science Department offers courses on world history, culture and geography; U.S. history and geography; principles of American democracy; and economics.

            Students in grades 9 or 10 study major turning points that shaped the modern world, from the late eighteenth century through the present.

            After a review of the nation's beginnings, students in grade 11 study the development of U.S. democratic ideals and the major turning points in American history in the 20th century.

            During the first semester of grade 12, students pursue a deeper understanding of U.S. national, state and local government. In the second semester, they study the basic principles of economics.
