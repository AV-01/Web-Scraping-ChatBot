HOW TO PRACTICE SELF-CAREHOW TO PRACTICE SELF-CARE


If life gets stressful and overwhelming, it's important to give your mind and body the breaks they need.  Below are some tips to include self-care in your routine.
 



 Identify what activities help you feel your best. Self-care for one person will mean something completely different for someone else.  One person may need more alone time, for example, while another may nurture herself by spending more time out with friends. 
Put it on your calendar - in ink! Take a close look at your calendar and carve out one or two hours for self-care and stick to it. This may take extra prep, but it's worth it. 
Sneak in self-care where you can. If you don't have huge chunks of time, you can still fit in little moments of relaxation. Don't wait to add self-care to your life until your schedule frees up (you might be waiting a while to forever). Try taking just five minutes to close your eyes and take some deep breaths, or go for a quick 10-minute walk. These small steps can make a big difference. 
Take care of yourself physically. This means getting enough sleep, eating nutritious foods, and exercising. When you take care of yourself physically, you will reap the benefits academically, emotionally, psychologically and inter-personally.
Know when to say no. Your health and well-being come first. If you're feeling stretched thin, prioritize your commitments and cut out what isn't fulfilling and truly important to you. 
Check-in with yourself regularly. Ask yourself these critical questions: "Am I working too much?" "Do I feel tapped out?" "What do I need to take away?" "What would I like to add?"
Surround yourself with great people. Make sure that the people in your life are upbeat, positive, and know how to enjoy life! 
Consider the quality of self-care. Go for quality, especially when quantity is lacking. For instance, rather than getting sucked into channel surfing for hours, watch only shows you've recorded that you truly enjoy. 
Remember that self-care is non-negotiable. In order to live a healthy and rewarding life, self-care is a necessity. With this mindset, prioritizing self-care can become very natural and easy to do.

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND SLEEPHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND SLEEP


What happens when students aren't getting the sleep they need?  Lack of consistent, appropriate sleep leads to increased academic stress, hindered concentration and learning, and disturbances to your students' mood and ability to cope.
 
 
What can parents do?

Have a lights out policy.
Take away computers, video games, cell phones, etc.
Help your child establish a regular sleep and wake cycle (Students need 8 to 9 hours of sleep each night).
Have students keep a regular study cycle (no late night cramming sessions).
Eliminate caffeine 3 to 5 hours before bed (soda, tea, coffee).
