Varsity Coaches:
Head Coach - Scott Bergemann - sbergemann@rocklinusd.org - (916) 769-0692
I began playing Water Polo at 13 years old, two weeks before competing in my first Junior Olympic Tournament. Fortunately, I had been swimming since the age of 5, providing me with a solid foundation for the game. I continued to play at Woodcreek HS, as well as year around with a competitive club. I went on to play at Cal Lutheran University, where I earned a B.A. in English, eventually adding a Masters in Education. I now work as a teacher here at Rocklin High School in the Social Studies Department. In addition to RHS Water Polo, I also coach for the California Republic Club Program in an effort to help student-athletes reach their greatest potential while competing at the highest level.
