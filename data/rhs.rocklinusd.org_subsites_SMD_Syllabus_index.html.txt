Parents:
We are in room V-51. We are interested in working closely with you and your student to maximize growth and learning. Communication between school and home is vital for your student's
progress. Please feel free to contact me about any concerns you may have.
You may send me an e-mail at dbressler@rocklin.k12.ca.us or leave me a voicemail and I will get back
to you as soon as I can. We will also send home a daily communication book for ongoing discussions.
