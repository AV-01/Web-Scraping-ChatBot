Rocklin High School
Welcome to the Rocklin High School Chemistry Department!


Students, in order to access all the notes, worksheets, activities, etc., you will need to create an account in Schoology and join the Chemistry Course corresponding to your teacher and class period. You will need to see your teacher for that code. The last step is to be approved by your instructor before you will be able to access course information.


If you need help, please feel free to set up an appointment with your teacher for help before school, after school, or at lunch, and we would be happy to help you.
We look forward to working with you this year!
Ms. DeMaria and Mr. Werner
