Senior ads are an integral part of the Rocklin High yearbook program. They are intended to allow parents, family and friends send a public display of affection to graduates and are subject to the policies published online. A new option will be coming soon allowing parents to pay for their ad and create it all on-line.  Check back for more information.  If you have questions, please email us at RocklinHSmedia@Rocklinusd.org.
