Welcome to the 2015/2016 school year.  It will be a pleasure working with your student this year.  It is important that we maintain consistent contact between the home and school, so please don’t hesitate to email or call if you have any questions or concerns. Schoology is a great tool to follow what is going on in our class.
 This year we will be studying Biology. We begin with Life Science covering plants and animals. During the second semester we will focus on the human body including the various systems.
