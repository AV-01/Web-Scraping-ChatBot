Dance Class Policies
Dance Class Policies
*Rocklin Dance is part of the Visual and Performing Arts Department, though students can opt to choose P.E. credit in lieu of VAPA credit.  Students make these decisions with their assigned counselor.
*Students have an unlimited amount of extra credit opportunities by attending  teacher-approved dance shows and following the RHS Dance Critique Guidelines.  Each written critique can earn up to 25 points!
*All students must have jazz shoes by October 1st of each school year  in order to receive their participation points.  All students will be wearing TAN jazz shoes in their dance show.
*Late work is always accepted; students can receive up to 70% credit.
*If a student has a parent or doctor’s note requesting that they do not participate in a class period, they are still required to fully dress down (just as they would with any P.E. course) and will need to complete a make-up assignment in order to receive participation points for the day.   Post-dated parent notes are not accepted.
*If a student can not participate in dance for more than 6 weeks per a doctor’s note, they will not receive credit for the semester.
*You can only receive participation points if you come to class (on time, following the participation point guidelines above) - come to class!!
Dance Class Auditions for the following school year are always  in the Spring, we announce the dates around January!  If you are interested in Dance 1 and do not have dance experience then you just sign up for the class.  If you have dance experience then you will get to audition for an upper level class.
