Course Description
¡Bienvenidos a Español III Honores! I am looking forward to a year of big growth opportunities in developing Spanish Language proficiency in all skill areas: listening, speaking, reading and writing. We will emphasize the ability to communicate both orally and in writing in Spanish. Activities will include: singing songs, reading stories, partner & group presentations, writing, role playing, student driven lessons, grammar games, cultural readings/videos, quizzes and exams.
