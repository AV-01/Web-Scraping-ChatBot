 Systems of specialized cells within organisms help them
perform the essential functions of life. (HS-LS1-1)

 All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA
molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the
instructions that code for the formation of proteins, which carry
out most of the work of cells. (HS-LS1-1) (Note: This
Disciplinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS-LS3-1.)



  Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural
    organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous
    parts and is itself a component of the next level. (HS-LS1-2)
    


  Feedback mechanisms maintain a living system’s internal
    conditions within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing
    it to remain alive and functional even as external conditions
    change within some range. Feedback mechanisms can
    encourage (through positive feedback) or discourage (negative
    feedback) what is going on inside the living system. (HS-LS1-3)
