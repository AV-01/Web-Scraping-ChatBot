Course Description: US History is a required course for graduation.  Studies in this course will provide students with a broad look at the history of the United States from the Foundations to the start of the 21st century.  Understanding  US history and how it applies to today’s society will provide students with the skills and knowledge to become actively involved in their own history.  To “experience” US history and the situations/choices made in our nations past, we will use primary source materials, simulations, projects, independent study/analysis, cooperative group activities, and other strategies to look at our history. As a contributing member of society and a member of our history here in the 20th century, it will be important that you are an informed citizen of the world.

● Tests/projects/essays which are not completed on time or earn less than 50% will receive a grade of 60% upon attainment of mastery. 
● All projects/essays must be turned in on the due date regardless of absence.  
● Students absent on the day of a test will be expected to make up that test upon their return.
Grading Policy for Interactive Student Notebook (Homework/Classwork/Performance)
Non-essential skills and concepts will be graded in the following manner:
● We accept late work on non-essential assignments for 50 percent credit, until the end of the current unit of study.  Late work may be accepted beyond the end of the unit, at teacher discretion.
***The student’s grade will be derived from an average of all work completed during each unit of study and based on the following breakdown:
