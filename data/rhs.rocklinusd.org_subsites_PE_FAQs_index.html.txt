Writing a note
:  If your student needs to be excused for PE please send a note on the day you would like them excused.  Our goal is to keep students engaged whenever possible/appropriate. Please include specific information so that whenever possible we can MODIFY activity to keep your student involved. Notes should include students first and last name, date, and reason along with a parent signature and contact information. If the student is unable to earn participation points, by completeing the daily activites, they will be encouraged to attend and participation in Flex time to earn missed points.
SAMPLE NOTE
2.
When my student brings a note to be excused from PE does he/she still need to dress ou
t?
YES!
Students not participating in P.E. due to parent note are REQUIRED to dress in P.E. uniform (unless physically unable to)  and participate in a modified activity (when appropriate). If they are unable to participate in the activities they may earn their points when they are heathly enought to do so during Plus Period   (See Flex Period PE Make-Ups)
3.  Does my student "lose points" if they have a doctor's note.
Students who are not able to participate will not earn daily participation points.  IF activities can be modified appropriately and safely with direction from the Physician, students may be able to earn partial to full credit.  Student missing participation have the opportunity to earn any points missed during Flex Period (see Flex Period PE Make-Ups)
3.
Are black shirt/shorts okay ?
NO: PE Shorts must be Royal Blue, shirts must be Gray
4. Are "soffe" shorts okay?
NO:  RHS PE requires that students wear shorts of appropriate length- think basketball or soccer style shorts.  "Short" shorts are not appropriate.
5.
What about sweatshirts or pants?
Students may wear them IF they are blue/gray.
6.
If my student loses points can they earn them back?
YES! Students may earn back points lost due to lack of participation, fitness, non-suits, absences, etc… by participating in correctives offered during any Flex period.
7.
Will my student lose points when they are absent?
Yes- Physical Education is rooted in participation.  Students who are absent will be encouraged to attend correctives during Flex time.  Any assessments/written assignments missed will also need to be made up.
8.
Will my student athlete lose points when they miss class due to RHS Athletic event?
Maybe.  Athletes MUST communicate AHEAD of time (preferably one class period before absence) and will be held accountable for any assignment/test they miss- they will not need to make-up "participation" .
9.
…
Any health issues that may affect the student’s participation in P.E. activities needs to be documented by a Physician and on file with both the School Health Office and the P.E. Teacher before activity begins.(i.e. asthma, OSD, scoliosis, IBS, …)
Forms are available on the "Medical Questions" page of our website.
10. If I have filed a medical form with the main office, why do I have to do another one for the PE Department?
Two reasons; first- it can take some time for information to filter to us from the main office due to the volume of information they are dealing with.  Second, it helps us work with students and safely modify activity while holding them accountable for activities they should be doing/medications they should be using/etc
and holding them out of activities they should not be participating in.
11.
Do students exercise outside when the air quality is bad?
RHS PE staff monitors the AQI

12.
