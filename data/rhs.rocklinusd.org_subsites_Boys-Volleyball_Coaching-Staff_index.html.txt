Kate Mitchell, Varsity Head Coach
 
Kate Mitchell graduated from Rocklin High School in 2014 and played volleyball all four years, three years on Varsity. She played volleyball for four years at Southwestern University in Texas and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics.  She returned to Rocklin and started coaching in the girls volleyball program in 2018. Kate has also been a coach for the Rocklin Volleyball Club program. In addition, she began working with the boys varsity program as an assistant coach in 2019 and will be continuing that role this year (2024) in a larger capacity.  She is enthusiastic about coaching volleyball and is an amazing asset to our program!
