Tools for the college and career search process have progressed significantly over the years. We have found online search tools to be very convenient and beneficial. Online programs are fun to play around with and explore.  Assessments can serve to help students learn about their interests and discover where they may fit in terms of professional occupations. Personal assessments serve to help students narrow their options to a group of potential career choices. This allows students to do more thorough research on occupations before they make a decision about which to pursue. 
 
Rocklin Unified School District has two exploration platforms that we encourage our students to utilize.  They both offer career exploration and assessments.
 
CaliforniaColleges.edu:  Student instructions to create your account.
SCOIR (can not be taken until Sophmore year):  

In order for your student to utilize Scoir through Rocklin Unified School District they need to create an account through a link that is sent to them through RHS.  
They can not just register on the Scoir website they need to register through the link given to them.  Otherwise they will not be linked correctly through their school.
