 Welcome to the 2015/2016 school year. It will be a pleasure working with your student this year. It is important that we maintain consistent contact between the home and school, so please don’t hesitate to email or call if you have any questions or concerns. If you email your student’s other teachers with concerns, please cc me so we can all work together.


 For the first 10-15 minutes of each study skills class, all students will complete a warm-up and/or silently read a book to help prepare them for the class. We will also work on study tools with instruction on: organization, time management, parts of a textbook, test taking skills, listening skills, note taking skills, outlining communication skills (asking for help when needed). During this time, we will also work on their IEP transition goals and teach some life skills to help students prepare for life after high school. During the last 30 minutes, student will work on assignments from other classes. 


 As we focus on transition and life skills, one of the areas we want students to develop in is completing their homework at home. We will start homework assignments in our Study Skills class to ensure students understand what is expected. However, students will then need to complete their homework at home. We would appreciate if families could help support student in developing these good work habits.


 Please support your student by encouraging him/her to have a book to read in class. We will have silent reading every day, and they can also read their book in other classes once they have completed their work.


 Study skills grade is determined by how well the student follows the rubric on the back of this page.  
Planner / Grade Check 40%
Classwork / Warm Up 30%
Behavior, On Task, Being Prepared  30%
