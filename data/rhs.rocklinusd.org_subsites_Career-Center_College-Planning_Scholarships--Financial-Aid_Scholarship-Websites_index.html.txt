When searching for scholarships online, beware of scams...
 

"You're a finalist!" or "You've won!" a contest or scholarship you never entered. Be wary, especially if they ask you for a credit card or bank account number to hold your "winnings." Don't believe it. You must apply for scholarships first to receive them."First come, first served." While you do need to get your application in before the scholarship deadlines, the "first come, first served" rule does not apply to scholarships.
 
"It's guaranteed!" Scholarship searches can guarantee search results. They can't guarantee you the scholarship money."We'll do the work for you ... for a fee." The fee may be nominal and the offer may come from someone who sounds official. So make sure you do your research before paying anyone to do a search for you.
 
NEVER PAY ANYONE FOR SCHOLARSHIP INFORMATION!
