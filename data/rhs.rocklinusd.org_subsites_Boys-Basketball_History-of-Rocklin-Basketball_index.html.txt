History of Rocklin Basketball



Where it all began...Where it all began...




1993 - 2010

Rocklin Basketball began its HUSTLE roots in 1993 when Coach Steve Taylor became the first Head Basketball coach when Rocklin HS opened. Coach Taylor grew up in the Rocklin area and attended Roseville HS where he played Football and Basketball. He then went on to play basketball at Fresno Pacific University. He began his teaching career in the Clovis/Fresno area before moving back to Rocklin to become the inaugural Head Coach. 
 

2010-2012

Coach Michael Lorente became the 2nd coach in Rocklin Basketball history. He coached for 2 years before leaving RHS.
 

2012-2016

Coach Casey Cutts, a former player of Coach Taylor, became the 3rd coach in Rocklin Basketball history. Coach Cutts played at Rocklin from 2001-2004 and left his coaching duties in 2016 after 4 years in the lead.
 

2016-Present

Coach Steve Taylor is back at the helm where he has added two more SFL Championships, numerous SJS playoff wins, and multiple Norcal playoff wins. Coach Taylor eclipsed the 500 career win mark in 2024 while guiding the Thunder to a SFL Championship, and D1 SJS Semi-Finals appearance, and a Norcal tournament appearance.
