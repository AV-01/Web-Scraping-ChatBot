Welcome to the 2015/2016 school year.  It will be a pleasure working with your student this year.  It is important that we maintain consistent contact between the home and school, so please don’t hesitate to email or call if you have any questions or concerns. Schoology is a great tool to follow what is going on in our class.
This year we will be studying World History and following the theme of The Road to Democracy. We begin with the Age of Kings and continue to the present day. Our textbook for the class is World History by Wayne King and Marcel Lewinski published by AGS, Inc (2001). In addition, we will also be using news articles to look at current events as they apply to our course of study.
