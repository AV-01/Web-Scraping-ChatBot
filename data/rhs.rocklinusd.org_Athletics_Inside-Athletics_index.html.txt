Vision


The Rocklin High School Athletic program is and integral part of the Rocklin High School learning experience.  The RHS student athlete experience is a result of the “six Pillars of Success” as outlined in the Rocklin High School handbook; a lifelong learner and continually improving.   


 
Philosophy


The Athletic Department's philosophy is a result of the systemic philosophy of Rocklin High School and the structures that facilitate these beliefs.  Specifically, the “Six Pillars of Success” that outline our expected learning results (ESLR’s) have driven our Athletic philosophy.  They include the following:


Character - Humility, Respect, Honesty, Integrity, Responsibility, Leadership, and Sportsmanship


Communication - to communicate openly and honestly in constructive manner.


Commitment - to be “present” and dedicated with your whole heart to the goals of self, team, school and community.    


Curriculum - to develop self-directed learners through the process inherent within the skills, ability and knowledge of each sport.    


Challenge - “Embrace the battle” – Fearless and self motivated players and team that persevere / excel in pressure situations and do not let the final outcome discourage them from maximizing their potential.


Community - We are a united group of people that believe in being part of something bigger than ourselves which brings out the best in each of us as individuals.  To that wend, we create and institute methods to support and enhance team, school and city-wide community.
