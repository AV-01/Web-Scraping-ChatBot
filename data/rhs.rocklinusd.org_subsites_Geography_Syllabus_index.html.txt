Students:
Stop by Room 14C during lunch or after school or e-mail me with any
questions or concerns you have (I prefer e-mail to voicemail). I am
always eager to help you succeed in my classes.

Parents:
Communication between school and home is vital for your student's
progress. Please feel free to contact me about any concern you may have.
You may send me an e-mail or leave me a voicemail and I will get back
to you as soon as I can, but usually I can't reply during school hours.
Please make an appointment if you want to have a lengthy discussion, but
feel free to stop into the classroom after school for a quick chat.
