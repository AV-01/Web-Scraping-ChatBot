Letters of Recommendation







If you need a letter of recommendation from a school staff member for a college application, scholarship, or program application, please complete the form below and give it to them along with a copy of your transcript and your extra-curricular activities resume. Make sure you give them plenty of time (at least 2 weeks), because these things tend to be seasonal and teachers are often asked to write them for several students. It is always best to have a conversation with the teacher regarding what the letter is needed for and which of your attributes they should focus the letter on. It may feel like bragging, but understanding what exactly you need in the letter will really help the teacher give you the best recommendation possible.
