How Do I Prepare?

This prep course is taught by two Granite Bay High School teachers. This class is offered throughout the year at Granite Bay High School and via Zoom. The course is typically four weeks long and broken into two sections (Math and English) so students may take either one or both. They also offer a week-long intensive summer workshop each year.  Here is the link for Summer 2024

Revolution Prep is offering a live online full length practice SAT and ACT exams for RHS students. Students will be sent all test materials electronically and then log into a Zoom at test time, where a proctor will make the exact announcements and keep the exact timing for each section as a student would hear during a real test.
