OVERVIEW
Math Analysis will focus on extending students knowledge from Algebra II and introducing topics from trigonometry and discrete mathematics.  These topics include: trigonometry (unit circle and triangle definitions, trigonometric values of important angles, identities, and numerous applications), conic sections, inequalities, and the exploration and interpretation of functions. These functions include: algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, rational and polynomial functions. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of statistics and data analysis. Students are expected to be active learners in this class. Important keys for success are: 


* Work all period on MATHEMATICS.  Stopping early is not acceptable behavior.
* Listen and participate in class discussions.
* Show all your steps neatly; don’t take shortcuts to get done.
*Do your homework everyday.


CALCULATORS
The teacher will have very few calculators for students to use during class. Since classes are going to be large, it is recommended that students have their own graphing calculators. The Rocklin High School mathematics’ department recommends the TI-83 or TI-84, although other calculators are acceptable.


GRADING
Points will be weighted in the following four categories:
• Tests 30%
• Essential Skills 30%


• Assignments 25% (includes Homework quiz scores)
• Quizzes 15%


Grades will be earned as follows:
 100 - 90% A
   89  - 80% B 
   79 - 70% C 
   69 -  0% NC
Note:  If a student is in danger of not passing Spring semester, Math Tutorial credit may be given at the end of Spring semester  to those students with an overall percentage above 60% and homework percentage above 70%. This is at the teacher’s discretion.


COMMUNICATION:
Daily assignments, handouts, and calendar for the class can be found on the RHS website under teacher links and Schoology and grades can be found using the grades link on the Rocklin High School homepage.


COMMENTS
I cannot stress enough how important homework is to passing this class. Students who do not complete assignments almost assuredly will struggle in the course. In addition, should you need help, please do not wait to ask for it.  I am available every morning after 7:15 AM, and after school or other times by appointment. Please make sure I know you are coming to meet with me so I can make room for you in my schedule. I also recommend that students work in groups outside of class. Previous students of mine have found this to be very effective.
