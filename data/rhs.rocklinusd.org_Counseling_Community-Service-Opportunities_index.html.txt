Community Service Opportunities







As a graduation requirement, students must complete 25 hours of community service work. These hours can be completed for any non-profit organization through clubs, athletic teams, or individually throughout the year. Students completing 150 or more community service hours are eligible for distinguished community service awards.
 
Students need to document their community service hours on the Community Service Contract (see link below) and return it to the counseling office or the College and Career Center.
               

Please visit the Rocklin High School Counseling Office community service board
for current and upcoming opportunities to volunteer.
