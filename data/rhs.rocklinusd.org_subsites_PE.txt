Welcome to RHS PHYSICAL EDUCATIONWelcome to RHS PHYSICAL EDUCATION


It is the goal of the Physical Education department to provide students with opportunities to develop an optimal level of physical fitness through the use of psychomotor development activities, cardiovascular endurance/flexibility/strength training, and wellness education.  Health related activities are integral part of the program at all levels.  The emphasis in activities is to provide an awareness of the importance of daily exercise, social skills, sportsmanship, and the enjoyment of physical activity throughout a lifetime. Health related fitness tests are administered each quarter to all students in order to better assess student progress.
