Clubs
Rocklin High School has a large variety of clubs that cover a broad range of topics.  There are long standing academic clubs such as CSF and French Club as well as social clubs such as Picnic Club and Poetry Club.  If you don't see a club that interests you, than start your own!  The only criteria for starting a club is that you share a similar interest as other people.  We've even had a club in the past titled "The Johnny Depp Appreciation League".  Some clubs have lasted over a decade while others come and go each year.
