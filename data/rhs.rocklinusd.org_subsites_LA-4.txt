Welcome to LA IV
Twelfth grade language arts provides a rigorous thematic course of study designed to acquaint students with the demands of college-level work. Our work will explore the question: What is the self? Content has been selected to illuminate different aspects of the theme of identity: How do we define ourselves in relation to family, friends, culture, society and government? How do people gain or lose control of their identities? Who are we and who do we want to be? Students read extensively from a rich world literature curriculum (up to 100 pages per week in novels, plays, short stories, nonfiction and poetry) and write frequently for different purposes and audiences and in a variety of styles (including expository and analytical essays, short fiction, poetry, and informal responses to literature and discussion). Writing assignments emphasize the development of academic skills necessary for students to thrive in college course work. Direct grammar and usage instruction are connected to specific writing assignments and to the needs and interests of students. Writing skills developed include: smooth integration of quotations, closing analytical gaps in argumentation, research organization, use of active voice, pronoun usage, punctuation, conventions of academic writing, use of MLA style, and other areas based on student interest or need. In addition, senior language arts classes aim to develop important skills in speaking and listening through collaboration, presentation and, especially, through Socratic seminar discussion. In these discussions (which form a touchstone for the learning of the course), students take a leadership role, helping to set the agenda for discussion and assuming facilitation duties.
