GENERAL INFORMATION FOR PE MAKE-UPS
 


 



Activities will include general fitness activities at the teachers discretion. Any medical limitations will apply to make-up activities but students must inform the supervising teacher.




 


 
Participation requires proper PE attire and sign-in
Participation make ups are offered Tuesdays-Fridays during Flex time, meet at the pool )swm) or in the stadium at 10:25.
   Students arriving late will not be able to participate
Successful completetion of one 25 minute make-up will earn 5 points.Specific Assignment make-ups can be completed by appointment with your teacher or during Flex time.  
                  (ex. Written tests, skills tests, lab activities…)
Students who miss class due to AP exams and Athletic Events are required to notify their teacher ahead of time (one class period). These students will  be responsible for any assigment or assessment missed, but will not be required to make up daily participation. 
Students may be assigned to Flex time at the discretion of their teacher. 
Students may "bank" points by completing make-ups before needed.  Ex. If a student is going to be ablsent they can complete make-ups before they go.                   

There are NO MAKE-UPS BEFORE or AFTER SCHOOL
