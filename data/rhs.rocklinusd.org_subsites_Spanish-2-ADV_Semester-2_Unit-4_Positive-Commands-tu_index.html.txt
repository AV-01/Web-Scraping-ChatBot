POSITIVE COMMANDS TO A FRIEND
To "tell" or "command" someone what to do-- use a POSITIVE command.
-- use a POSITIVE command.
I
To form the POSITIVE command take the
Tú
form of the present tense verb
and drop the final "s".
Example: Tú hablas = ¡ Habla ! Tú pierdes = ¡Pierde !
Tú comes = ¡ Come ! Tú vives = ¡Vive!
Tú duermes = ¡Duerme! Tú subes = ¡Sube!
II.
If the command is reflexive, take off the "se" from the end of the infinitive, conjugate the verb like you have done above [ by using the Tú form of the verb and dropping the final "s"] ,
and then add "te" on the end
to make the action reflexive.
[ by using the Tú form of the verb and dropping the final "s"] ,  to make the action reflexive.
Example: **Be Quiet! Calla + te =
cállate
!
**Sit Down! Sienta + te =
síentate
!

IV . Positive Tú commands with Pronouns [ command + IOP + DOP
CID
]
Where do you place the pronouns?
-When you use a pronoun (s) with a command
attach the pronoun (s) to the end of the command. (CID)
IOP
of a sentence is usually the
Person that is indirectly receiving the action.
DOP
of a sentence is usually the
Thing
that is indirectly receiving the action.

If there are no pronouns added, do you need to add accent marks to commands?
-If the command has multi-syllables, but you aren’t adding any pronouns, no accent will be needed because you aren’t adding syllables and the stress of your voice naturally falls where it is needed.
-If the command has multi-syllables, but you aren’t adding any pronouns, no accent will be needed because you aren’t adding syllables and the stress of your voice naturally falls where it is needed.
Examples: Begin=
¡ Em/
pie
/za !
(3 syllables, Grave word-stress falls on 2nd to last syllable & no
pronouns added & command ends in a vowel so no written accent mark
is needed)
FYI:
accents only go over vowels
.
Generally, you add a written accent mark if the command is 2 or more syllables, and you are adding 1 pronoun. Because you are adding a pronoun you are adding a syllable which then changes the stress . You want to keep the original stress-that is why you have to have a written accent mark.
The written accent is stressed on the 3
rd
to the last syllable.
Example: Prepare the meat (la carne)!
= ¡ Prepárala ! OR Study it! = ¡ estúdialo ¡
When the original command is 2 or more syllables AND you add
both
pronouns (indirect and direct) then
the
written accent goes on what was the next to the last syllable of the original command
.
Example: Buy the shoes for her!
=
¡
Cóm
/pra/se/los!
(original command is two syllables and
we are adding both IOP and DOP—therefore, there are 4 syllables. Sobreesdrújula,
stress falls on the 4
th
to last syllable & accent is always needed)
When the command is one syllable and you are adding both IOP and DOP pronouns.
The written accent is stressed on the 3
rd
to the last syllable.
Example: Give me it! = ¡Dámelo!
Tell them it! = ¡Díselo!
Note:
A, E, O are strong vowels. U & I are weak. If two strong vowels are side by side in Spanish, they are always separate syllables within a single word [example: tr
á/e
/me/los] In addition, a diphthong is the combination of an unstressed "weak" vowel and strong vowel. The stress falls on a weak vowel (i or u) which comes immediately before or after a strong vowel (a, e, o). There are exceptions for preserving the original sound of the command like alquílaselo or léenoslos.
Español II
Reglas de acentuación: ¡es mágico!
ALL
words in
ALL languages
have an accented (stressed) syllable! In some languages, like SPANISH, the stressed syllable in SOME words
must be marked with an "accent" because the word does not "fit" into one of the categories w/o it, or as some textbooks describe: these words "break the rules"…
Each type of word in Spanish even has a
special name
, see categories in the table.
This information will be very useful in higher levels of Spanish and even in
A
guda
G
rave
E
sdrújula
S
obreesdrújula
The stress is on the
last
syllable
(última sílaba)
The stress is on the
second to last
to last syllable
(Penúltima sílaba)
The stress is on the
third to the last
to the last syllable
(antepenúltima sílaba)
The stress is on the
fourth to last syllable
to last syllable
(antes de la antepenúltima sílaba)

As we add pronouns we are adding syllables, so in order to preserve the
original stress
(& pronunciation) of the verb we
MUST
mark the stress with a
written accent
Spanish II when trying to figure out where to put the accent mark on the commands w/ pronouns attached! Btw, the largest group (w/ the most words) is the
GRAVE
group!
Remember: Accents through the AGES…..
The is in the steps! Just follow the table!
Give your friend commands.
Remember to attach pronouns to the end of the commands (IF NECESSARY) and be careful of stem-changers and irregulars!!!! Put the exclamation marks on all.
