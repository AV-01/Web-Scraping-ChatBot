The 2024-2025 FAFSA and California Dream Act Application (CADAA) become available in December 2023 and must be completed by April 2, 2024 (in order to be eligible for a Cal Grant).  Be sure to check the financial aid page of each college where you are applying to see if they have any earlier financial aid deadlines of their own. The website to complete your FAFSA is www.fafsa.gov. The "FA" is FAFSA stands for "Free Application" so if you are asked to pay a fee to submit your FAFSA, you are not on the official government site. The website to complete your California Dream Act Application is www.dream.csac.ca.gov. The CADAA application is for immigrant students who do not qualify for federal student aid. If you are unsure which application is for you, check out this document.

 
To complete your FAFSA, you will need the following:

 

Create your StudentAid.gov Account/FSA ID  
Your Social Security Number
Your Alien Registration Number (if you are not a U.S. citizen)
Your 2022 federal income tax returns, W-2s, and other records of money earned. (Note: You may be able to transfer your federal tax return information into your FAFSA using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.)
Bank statements and records of investments (if applicable)
Records of untaxed income (if applicable)

What does completing the FAFSA/CADAA do for me?
In addition to qualifying you for federal and/or state financial aid, many schools also use your FAFSA/CADAA information to qualify you for their institutional aid. The FAFSA can also provide a safety net of available loans or the ability to reconsider aid packages if a family's financial situation changes during the school year. It is recommended that ALL college bound students complete a FAFSA. Completing the application does not commit you to accepting any type of aid. Explore the links below to learn more.
