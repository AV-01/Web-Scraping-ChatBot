Junior Rocklin Summer Civic Program







The City of Rocklin has joined with the Rocklin Educational Excellence Foundation (REEF) and the Rocklin Unified School District to offer the Summer Civic Career Program (SCCP) to our Junior, soon to be Senior students.  SCCP introduces students to the many local government career opportunities. This program allows students to make important contributions to the City while participating in a challenging and rewarding work experience. During the two-week program, students will partner with City staff and assist with a variety of programs and projects in various departments.  The students will also be awarded a $500 scholarship.
 
The two-week program is scheduled for June 10-13 and June 17-20, 2024, Monday through Thursday, 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM. If you are interested in applying for this program please see this flyer and application. Applications are due to Mrs. Lund in the College & Career Center by April 3, 2024 at 3:00 pm.
 
If you have any questions you can reach out to Rachel Lund at rlund@rocklinusd.org.
