Prep: periods 3and 8
AP STATISTICS: This course is designed to teach the equivalent of a college level statistics class over a full year. The topics for AP Statistics are divided into four major themes: exploratory analysis, planning a study, probability, and statistical inference. The curriculum and rigor of the class will be designed to prepare students for success on the AP test.  The essential skills that will be covered in this course are:
-Displaying and Describing Data
-Binomial and Geometric Distributions
-Measures of Center and Spread
- Sampling Distributions (Proportions and Means)
-Standard Normal Calculations
- Confidence Intervals
-Least-Squares Regression
- Significance Tests (z and t tests)
-Experiments and Studies
- Chi-Square Distributions
-Probability
- Linear Regression Slope t-tests
-Random Variables
GRADING SYSTEM:  Students grades will determined as follows
o
Essential Skills (30%)
o
Tests (35%)
o
Quizzes (15%)
o
Special Problems (10%)
o
Homework/Class work (10%)
In order to receive a passing grade in AP Statistics, students will need to earn at least a 70% and show mastery on all essential concepts (State Standards). Failure to show mastery on all concepts will result in a final grade of NC. Students will have multiple opportunities to achieve mastery on the essential skills throughout each semester.
MATERIALS:  Students will need a TI-83 or 84 for the AP test and throughout the course.  The students will be able to borrow a calculator during class, but it will be very difficult to complete homework or other projects without a calculator.  In addition, students will need a three-ring binder, composition notebook and graph paper.   Students will also need to pay the AP test fee of $89 by February 1st.  All students in AP classes are highly encouraged to take the AP test.
OTHER INFORMATION: Statistics is unlike other mathematics offered at Rocklin High School.  Students will be required to completely explain their answers in addition to computations.  The ability to write and communicate statistics effectively is a major component of the AP test and students will be required to demonstrate this ability in this class.  Extra help is available before school, after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and other times by appointment.  Parent/ Teacher Communication can be made through email or voicemail.  Email is the preferred method and response time is usually quicker than through a voicemail message.   I am looking forward to a great year and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
