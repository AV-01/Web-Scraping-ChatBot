The Foreign Language Department provides a strong and broad curriculum. In the Foreign Language Department we currently offer both Spanish and French. Students need one year of Foreign Language to meet RHS high school graduation requirements. We strongly encourage more than two years to be competitive at the college/university level. Whether students choose to meet graduation requirements, to learn new skills or just to have fun, taking a foreign language offers students a wide variety of opportunities to practice the target language in written, oral, listening, and verbal formats.
We offer the following classes:
ASL
World Cultures
French 1, 2, 3, 3H, DE French
Spanish 1, 2, 2 ADV, 3, 3H, 4H and DE Spanish
