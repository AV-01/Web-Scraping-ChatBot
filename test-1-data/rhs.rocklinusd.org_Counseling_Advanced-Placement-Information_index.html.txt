AP Policies
Adding and Dropping classes: Students are given three weeks after school begins to drop an AP class if they find the class too difficult
A student is given the first semester to maintain AP appropriate level of work. If he/she does not maintain that level, he/she will be moved to a similar class at a lower level. This change will occur at the semester only.
