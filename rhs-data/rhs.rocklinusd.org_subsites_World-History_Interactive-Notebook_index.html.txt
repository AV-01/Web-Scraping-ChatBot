Interactive Student Notebook
Every World History student will need a 3 subject spiral bound notebook, 8.5 x 11, college ruled to be used only for their World History class. (or two 1-subject notebooks, one for each semester)
What is the purpose of the notebook?
The ISN enables students to be creative, independent thinkers and writers.  Interactive notebooks will be used for class notes, as well as for other activities where students will be asked to express their own ideas and process information presented in this class.  As you work with the notebook, it becomes a portfolio for your work thoughts and beliefs.  This notebook is different from traditional notebooks due to the fact that it provides activities for a variety of learning styles catering to Multiple Intelligences, and tasks all geared to how our brains learn best.  This notebook will be a valuable resource in preparing for tests.  The notebook is 30% of your entire grade.
How do I use the notebook?
The interactive notebooks encourage students to record information in an organized fashion.  We divide the notebooks into two different sides: left side activities and right side activities.  The right side of the notebook is the “input” side or the teacher side.  It contains the key information for the unit such as class notes, t-charts, and graphs.  Typically, all “testable” information will be found here.  The left side of the notebook is the “output” side or the student side, primarily used for processing new information.  Students work out an understanding of the material by using illustrations, diagrams, or flow charts.  Students explore their opinions and clarify values on issues, wonder about “what if” hypothetical situations and ask questions about new ideas. These activities will either PREVIEW or PROCESS new information.

How will the notebook be organized?
The ISN is divided into units of study based on our World History curriculum.  Each section will have a cover page and then all the activities and assignments for that unit.  In the back of the notebook, you will create a glossary of terms for the year.
How will my notebook be graded?
Notebooks will be checked periodically and these checks will not be announced.  All class notes and assignments should be included, even for the days you were absent.  This includes each being recorded in the table of contents.  Each right side assignment must be complete, have a heading, and the date assigned or given written on it.  Mostly it is checked on being complete but the left sides must be varied and not be a simple restatement or a picture with no processing of content from the right side.
What happens if I am absent?
If you are absent, it is your responsibility to obtain notebook assignments from either a classmate or the teacher.
