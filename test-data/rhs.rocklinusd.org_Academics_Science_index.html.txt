The Science Department provides in-depth study of scientific
principles, employing appropriate technology and hands-on laboratory
experiences at every level. Coursework prepares students for college
studies, as well as fulfilling high school requirements in Life Science,
Physical Science and Health.
All students are required to take
one year of Physical Science, one year of Life Science and one semester
of Health. It is highly recommended that any University-bound student
complete three years of science: Biology, Chemistry and Physics. For
those interested in pursuing a higher degree in science or engineering, a
fourth year of science is recommended.
