Varsity Coach - Tim Hurrianko
This is my 24th year coaching golf at Rocklin High school, and it's been one of the highlights of my teaching career. I have had the privilege of working with a plethora of wonderful young men, some of whom have went on to successful collegiate careers, and one now on the Korn Ferry Tour. Golf is a wonderful metaphor for life, and it has privided a lifetime of memories thanks to these wonderful players.
