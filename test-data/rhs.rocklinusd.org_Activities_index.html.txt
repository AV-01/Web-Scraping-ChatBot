Welcome to the wonderful world of Student Activities!!!
Make no mistake.... Rocklin High School,
first and foremost
, is an academic institution (The #1 academic institution in Placer County)..... But, if you spend four years here and only gain intellectual knowledge you have missed out on a very special part of the high school experience.  Academics should definitely be your top priority but be sure you get the full Rocklin High School experience by participating in student activities such as dances, rallies, clubs etc.  This site will help guide you to those life long memory making experiences!!
