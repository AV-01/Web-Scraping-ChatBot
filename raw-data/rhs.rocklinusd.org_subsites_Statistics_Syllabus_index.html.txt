STATISTICS:
This full year course is designed to introduce the students to statistics and prepare them to pass a required statistics class at the college level. The topics for Statistics are divided into four major themes: exploratory analysis, planning a study, probability, and statistical inference.  We will be using Stats: Modeling the World (Bock, Velleman, DeVeaux) for our text as well as many other resources.  The essential skills that will be covered in this course are:

Data Displays

Probability (2 parts)

Measures of Center and Spread

Random Variables

Standard Normal Calculations

Binomial and Geometric Distributions

Least-Squares Regression

Sampling Distributions

Contingency Tables

Confidence Intervals

Designing Experiments

Significance Tests (z, t)

1.
Graphing Calculator: You will need the TI 83 Plus Graphing calculator (or the TI 84) for this class.  Please acquire by September 8.  A TI-Inspire can be used, but order the Ti 84 faceplate.  If you have a different calculator than listed above, you will need to be able to consult the manual for many exercises.
2.
Loose-leaf notebook and graph paper: Loose-leaf is required for collected assignments. Assignments can be typed.
3.
Blue or black pens, pencils, a ruler. No assignments, tests, or quizzes will be accepted if written in any other color ink then blue or black. (Pencil is best.)

All students will receive a grade or an NC (no credit) at the end of each semester.  The easiest way to fail this class is to avoid the homework.  It is expected that homework be completed by the following class period.  In addition to earning a minimum percentage of overall work (70%), students need to show mastery on all essential concepts (State Standards). Failure to show mastery on all concepts will result in a final grade of NC. Students will have multiple opportunities to achieve mastery throughout each semester.
EXTRA HELP:
Extra help is available before school any day after 7:10, after school until 3:00 pm, and other times by appointment.  Additional time may be scheduled during the year as determined by need.
WEBSITES:
Students and parents can check the course calendar, assignments and handouts using the teacher links from the RHS website or the following: www.edline.net or at the schoology class site at http://schoology.rocklinusd.org/
Parent/ Teacher Communication
can be made through email or telephone conversation.  Email is the preferred method and response time is quicker than through a voicemail message.  Parents will be informed of serious discipline or academic problems.  My email is: emitchell@rocklin.k12.ca.us
