Applying to Colleges
Don't Worry, You've Got This!
Applying to college can be a daunting task, but you don't have to do it alone! Take advantage of the MANY resources available in the College and Career Center. Pre-recorded workshops will post here throughout the fall and you can also register for live webinars, drop-in Q&A, or application essay review sessions. One-on-one meetings can also be booked with college and career center staff to assist you. Don't be afraid to contact college admission reps at the schools you are interested in. Their entire purpose is to help you get admitted. Everyone wants to see you succeed, so reach out, rally your support team and get to work together!
